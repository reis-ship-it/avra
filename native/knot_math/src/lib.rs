// Knot Theory Mathematics Library
// Phase 1: Core Knot System
// 
// This library provides Rust implementations of:
// - Polynomial mathematics (Jones, Alexander polynomials)
// - Braid group operations
// - Knot invariants calculations
// - Knot energy calculations (physics-based)
// - Knot dynamics (ODE solvers)
// - Statistical mechanics (Boltzmann distribution, entropy)
