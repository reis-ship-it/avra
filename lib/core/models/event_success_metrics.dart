/// Event Success Metrics Model
/// 
/// Represents comprehensive success analysis for an event.
/// 
/// **Philosophy Alignment:**
/// - Opens doors to learning and improvement
/// - Enables data-driven event hosting
/// - Supports reputation building
/// - Feeds into recommendation algorithm
/// 
/// **Usage:**
/// ```dart
/// final metrics = EventSuccessMetrics(
///   eventId: 'event-123',
///   ticketsSold: 50,
///   actualAttendance: 45,
///   attendanceRate: 0.90,
///   averageRating: 4.5,
///   nps: 70,
///   successLevel: EventSuccessLevel.successful,
/// );
/// ```
