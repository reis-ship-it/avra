///
/// **Philosophy:** "Doors, not badges" - Opens doors to likeminded people and events
///
/// **Matching Signals:**
/// - Events hosted count (more events = higher signal)
/// - Event ratings (average rating from attendees)
/// - Followers count (users following the expert)
/// - External social following (if available)
/// - Community recognition (partnerships, collaborations)
/// - Event growth (community building - attendance growth over time)
/// - Active list respects (users adding events to their lists)
///
/// **Locality-Specific Weighting:**
/// - Higher weight for signals in user's locality
/// - Lower weight for signals outside locality
/// - Geographic interaction patterns (where user attends events)
///
/// **What Doors Does This Open?**
/// - Discovery Doors: Users find events from likeminded local experts
/// - Connection Doors: System matches users to events they'll enjoy
/// - Exploration Doors: Users can explore events outside their typical behavior
