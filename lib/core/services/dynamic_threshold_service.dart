/// Dynamic Threshold Service
/// 
/// Calculates locality-specific thresholds for local expert qualification.
/// Thresholds adapt to what each locality actually values, enabling lower
/// thresholds for activities valued by the locality and higher thresholds
/// for activities less valued by the locality.
/// 
/// **Philosophy:** Local experts shouldn't have to expand past their locality
/// to be qualified. Thresholds ebb and flow based on locality data, adapting
/// to what the community actually values.
/// 
/// **How This Works:**
/// - Gets base thresholds from ExpertiseRequirements
/// - Gets activity weights from LocalityValueAnalysisService
/// - Applies locality-specific adjustments based on activity weights
/// - Lower thresholds for activities valued by locality
/// - Higher thresholds for activities less valued by locality
/// - Thresholds update dynamically as locality behavior changes
