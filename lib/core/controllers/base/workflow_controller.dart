/// Base interface for all workflow controllers
/// 
/// Controllers orchestrate complex multi-step workflows that coordinate
/// multiple services. They provide a clean abstraction for business logic
/// that is too complex for simple BLoC operations.
/// 
/// **When to Use Controllers:**
/// - ✅ Multi-step workflows (3+ steps)
/// - ✅ Multiple services coordinated
/// - ✅ Complex validation logic
/// - ✅ Error handling across services
/// - ✅ Rollback/compensation needed
/// 
/// **When NOT to Use Controllers:**
/// - ❌ Simple CRUD operations (use BLoC directly)
/// - ❌ Single service calls (use BLoC directly)
/// - ❌ Simple state management (use BLoC directly)
/// 
/// **Architecture Pattern:**
/// ```
/// UI → BLoC → Controller → Multiple Services/Use Cases → Repository
/// ```
