# Knot Math Bridge

**Status:** ⏳ FFI Bindings Pending Generation

---

## Overview

This directory will contain the generated Dart bindings for the Rust `knot_math` library.

---

## Generated Files (Pending)

Once `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` is run, the following files will be generated:

- `knot_math_bridge.dart` - Dart bindings for Rust API
- `knot_math_bridge.h` - C header (for iOS)
- `knot_math_bridge.c` - C bindings (for macOS)

---

## Setup

See `docs/plans/knot_theory/FFI_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for complete setup instructions.

---

## Usage

Once bindings are generated, import in Dart:

```dart
import 'package:spots/core/services/knot/bridge/knot_math_bridge.dart';
```

**Note:** This directory is a placeholder. Files will be generated by `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen`.
