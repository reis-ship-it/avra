# Cursor Rule: Master Plan System

## 🎯 MANDATORY RULE: Master Plan Integration

**Trigger:** When user says "I want to add [feature]" or "I want to implement [feature]"

**Action Required:** Follow automated workflow to integrate into Master Plan

---

## 📋 Rule Details

### **When This Rule Applies:**

Anytime user requests:
- "I want to add [feature]"
- "I want to implement [feature]"
- "Let's build [feature]"
- "Create [feature]"
- Any new feature/implementation request

### **⚠️ CRITICAL: Master Plan is THE Execution Plan**

**All other plans are reference guides. Master Plan is the single source of truth for execution order.**

---

## 🤖 Automated Workflow

### **Step 1: Create Comprehensive Plan Document**

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before creating plan, read:**
- `docs/plans/philosophy_implementation/DOORS.md` - The conversation that revealed the truth
- `OUR_GUTS.md` - Core values (leads with doors philosophy)
- `docs/plans/philosophy_implementation/SPOTS_PHILOSOPHY_AND_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete philosophy guide
- `docs/plans/methodology/DEVELOPMENT_METHODOLOGY.md` - Complete methodology guide

1. **Create full implementation plan** with:
   - Complete implementation details
   - Phases, timelines, requirements
   - Technical specifications
   - Dependencies identified
   - **Doors questions answered** (What doors? When ready? Good key? Learning?)
   - **Methodology compliance** (Context gathering, quality standards, architecture alignment)

2. **Create plan folder structure:**
   - Create `docs/plans/[feature_name]/` folder
   - Move plan document to folder
   - Create supporting docs:
     - `progress.md` (detailed progress tracking)
     - `status.md` (current status)
     - `blockers.md` (blockers/dependencies)
     - `working_status.md` (what's being worked on now)

3. **Initialize supporting docs** with default content

4. **Verify philosophy alignment:**
   - Answer doors questions: What doors? When ready? Good key? Learning?
   - Verify architecture: ai2ai only, offline-first, self-improving
   - Ensure authentic value: Not gamification, real user benefit

### **Step 2: Add to Master Plan Tracker**

1. **Update `docs/MASTER_PLAN_TRACKER.md`:**
   - Add entry to appropriate section
   - Include ALL required fields:
     - Plan Name
     - Date (today's date)
     - Status (🟢 Active for new plans)
     - Priority (CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW)
     - Timeline (estimated duration)
     - File Path (relative link to plan folder)
   - Update Feature Cross-Reference Matrix if needed

### **Step 3: Analyze for Master Plan Integration**

1. **Determine dependencies:**
   - What does this feature need?
   - What features depend on this?
   - Check Master Plan for dependency conflicts

2. **Determine priority:**
   - How critical is this feature?
   - Does it block other work?
   - Is it foundational or enhancement?

3. **Determine feature area:**
   - Where does it fit logically?
   - What other features are similar?
   - Can phases be batched?

4. **Determine timeline:**
   - How long will it take?
   - What are the phases?
   - Can phases align with other features?

5. **Check for catch-up opportunities:**
   - Are there active features in Master Plan?
   - What phase are they in?
   - Can new feature catch up to enable parallel work?

### **Step 4: Insert into Master Plan**

1. **Read `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`** to understand current execution sequence

2. **Determine optimal position:**
   - If catch-up opportunity exists → use catch-up logic
   - If no catch-up → insert based on dependencies/priority/timeline
   - Consider batching common phases

3. **Update Master Plan execution sequence:**
   - Add feature to appropriate phase/week
   - Note parallel work opportunities
   - Update progress tracking section
   - Update current phase indicator

4. **Apply catch-up logic if applicable:**
   - Pause active features at current phase
   - Schedule new feature's catch-up phases
   - Schedule parallel work once caught up
   - Note finish-together timeline

### **Step 5: Update References**

1. **Update Master Plan Tracker** (already done in Step 2)

2. **Update any cross-references** in related plans

3. **Notify user** of integration and position in Master Plan

## 📐 Master Plan Structure

### **Master Plan Organization:**

The Master Plan (`docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`) organizes features by:
1. **Phases** (sequential phases within a feature)
2. **Priorities** (P0, P1, P2...)
3. **Dependencies** (A before B)
4. **Feature Areas** (monetization, expertise, events...)
5. **Timeline** (estimated duration)

**Result:** One optimized execution sequence considering all factors.

### **Catch-Up Prioritization Logic:**

**When new feature arrives:**
1. **Pause** active features at current phase
2. **Prioritize** new feature to catch up
3. **Resume** in parallel once caught up
4. **Finish** together

**Example:**
- Feature A at Service phase (100%)
- Feature B arrives (needs Models → Service → UI)
- Feature B catches up (Models, Service)
- Both work UI together in parallel
- Both finish together

## 📁 Folder Organization

### **Plan Folder Structure:**

```
docs/plans/
  [feature_name]/
    [FEATURE_NAME]_PLAN.md  (main plan document)
    progress.md              (detailed progress tracking)
    status.md                (current status)
    blockers.md               (blockers/dependencies)
    working_status.md         (what's being worked on now)
```

### **Master Plan References:**

- **Master Plan:** `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md` (execution sequence)
- **Master Plan Tracker:** `docs/MASTER_PLAN_TRACKER.md` (registry)
- **Master Plan Requirements:** `docs/MASTER_PLAN_REQUIREMENTS.md` (specifications)
