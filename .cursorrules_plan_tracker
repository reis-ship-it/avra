# Cursor Rule: Master Plan Tracker Auto-Update

## 🎯 MANDATORY RULE: Auto-Update Master Plan Tracker

**Trigger:** Whenever a new implementation plan document is created

**Action Required:** Immediately update `docs/MASTER_PLAN_TRACKER.md`

---

## 📋 Rule Details

### **When This Rule Applies:**

Anytime you create a document that is:
- An implementation plan
- A roadmap
- A strategy document
- A feature design with timeline
- Any document ending in `*PLAN*.md`, `*ROADMAP*.md`, `*STRATEGY*.md`

### **⚠️ CRITICAL: Check First, Then Create**

**Before creating a new plan, you MUST:**

1. **Read the Feature Cross-Reference Matrix** in MASTER_PLAN_TRACKER.md
2. **Use the Decision Tree** to determine if idea belongs in existing plan
3. **Check existing plans** to see if idea fits within scope
4. **Only create new plan if:**
   - Idea doesn't fit any existing plan
   - Idea is substantial (3+ days work)
   - Idea is not a sub-feature of existing plan

### **What You Must Do:**

**If idea belongs in EXISTING plan:**
- Open the existing plan document
- Add idea to appropriate section
- Update plan's "Last Updated" timestamp
- Note cross-references if needed
- **DO NOT create new plan**
- **DO NOT update tracker** (existing plan already tracked)

**If idea requires NEW plan:**

**Step 1: Create the plan document**
- Write the complete plan
- Save to `docs/` directory
- Include cross-references to related plans

**Step 2: IMMEDIATELY update MASTER_PLAN_TRACKER.md**
- Add new entry to appropriate section
- Include ALL required fields:
  - Plan Name
  - Date (today's date)
  - Status (🟢 Active for new plans)
  - Priority (CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW)
  - Timeline (estimated duration)
  - File Path (relative link)
- **Update Feature Cross-Reference Matrix** with new plan

**Step 3: Commit both files together**
- Plan document + tracker update = one commit

## 📝 Entry Template

```markdown
| Plan Name | Date | Status | Priority | Timeline | File Path |
|-----------|------|--------|----------|----------|-----------|
| [Plan Name] | YYYY-MM-DD | 🟢 Active | [Priority] | [Duration] | [`filename.md`](./filename.md) |
```

---

## ✅ Required Fields

1. **Plan Name** - Full descriptive name
2. **Date** - Creation date (YYYY-MM-DD)
3. **Status** - One of:
   - 🟢 Active (ready to implement)
   - 🟡 In Progress (currently implementing)
   - ✅ Complete (finished)
   - ⏸️ Paused (temporarily halted)
   - ❌ Deprecated (superseded)
4. **Priority** - One of: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
5. **Timeline** - Estimated duration (e.g., "5-7 days", "2 weeks", "3 months")
6. **File Path** - Relative markdown link to the plan document

---

## 🎯 Where to Add Entry

Add to the appropriate section based on plan type:

- **Philosophy & Architecture** - Core system design, philosophy
- **Feature Implementation** - New features, major additions
- **Testing & Quality** - Test plans, quality improvements
- **Migration & Fixes** - Migrations, bug fixes, refactoring
- **Deprecated Plans** - Old plans no longer relevant

Keep entries in **reverse chronological order** (newest first)

---

## ⚠️ Consequences of Not Following

If you create a plan document but don't update the tracker:
- ❌ Plan is invisible to project
- ❌ Duplicate plans may be created
- ❌ Dependencies won't be tracked
- ❌ Work may conflict with other plans
- ❌ Project management loses visibility

---

## 💡 Examples

### Example 1: New Feature Plan

**Created:** `docs/SOCIAL_FEED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

**Tracker Entry:**
```markdown
| Social Feed Implementation Plan | 2025-11-21 | 🟢 Active | HIGH | 3 weeks | [`SOCIAL_FEED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](./SOCIAL_FEED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) |
```

### Example 2: Quick Fix Strategy

**Created:** `docs/QUICK_FIX_STRATEGY.md`

**Tracker Entry:**
```markdown
| Quick Fix Strategy | 2025-11-21 | 🟡 In Progress | MEDIUM | 2 days | [`QUICK_FIX_STRATEGY.md`](./QUICK_FIX_STRATEGY.md) |
```

---

## 🔄 Updating Existing Entries

When plan status changes:

1. Find the plan entry in tracker
2. Update Status field
3. Add completion date if finished
4. Move to "Deprecated Plans" section if superseded

---

## 📊 Statistics Section

After adding/updating entries, update the statistics at bottom:

```markdown
**Total Plans:** [count]  
**Active:** [count]  
**In Progress:** [count]  
**Complete:** [count]  
**Paused:** [count]  
**Deprecated:** [count]  

**Last Updated:** [current date and time]
```

Every AI assistant working on SPOTS must:
- ✅ Know this rule exists
- ✅ Follow it every time
- ✅ Update tracker when creating plans
- ✅ Verify entry was added correctly

**No exceptions.**
