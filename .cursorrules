# SPOTS Development Protocol - Cursor AI Rules

## 🚨 MANDATORY: Session Start Protocol

**At the start of EVERY new chat/task, you MUST:**

1. **Read the entry point document:**
   ```
   read_file('docs/START_HERE_NEW_TASK.md')
   ```

2. **Determine task type:**
   - **Implementation task** (implement, create, build, add, start, proceed)
     → Follow 40-minute context gathering protocol
   - **Status/progress query** (where are we, what's the status, how far along)
     → Find and read ALL related documents (plan + complete + progress + status)

3. **Follow the protocol before any code:**
   - Do NOT skip to implementation
   - Do NOT skip context gathering
   - The 40-minute investment saves hours to days

## 🎯 Implementation Task Triggers

When user says any of these, read `START_HERE_NEW_TASK.md` first:

- "implement [feature]"
- "create [component]"
- "build [feature]"
- "add [functionality]"
- "start [task]"
- "proceed with [phase]"
- "continue with [feature]"
- "let's do [task]"
- "work on [feature]"

**Protocol:**
```
1. Read START_HERE_NEW_TASK.md (docs/plans/methodology/START_HERE_NEW_TASK.md)
2. Read DOORS.md (docs/plans/philosophy_implementation/DOORS.md) - MANDATORY
3. Read OUR_GUTS.md - MANDATORY
4. Read SPOTS Philosophy (docs/plans/philosophy_implementation/SPOTS_PHILOSOPHY_AND_ARCHITECTURE.md) - MANDATORY
5. Read Development Methodology (docs/plans/methodology/DEVELOPMENT_METHODOLOGY.md) - MANDATORY
6. Check Master Plan (docs/MASTER_PLAN.md) for current execution sequence
7. Check Master Plan Tracker (docs/MASTER_PLAN_TRACKER.md) for all plans
8. Discover ALL plans (glob_file_search in docs/plans/)
9. Filter by recency + relevance
10. Read high-priority plans
11. Search existing implementations
12. Answer doors questions (What doors? When ready? Good key? Learning?)
13. Create TODO list
14. Communicate plan
15. Get user approval
16. Begin implementation (following methodology and philosophy)
```

---

## 🔍 Status Query Triggers

When user says any of these, read ALL related documents:

- "where are we with [topic]"
- "what's the status of [topic]"
- "how far along is [topic]"
- "what's complete in [topic]"
- "show me progress on [topic]"
- "update me on [topic]"

**Protocol:**
```bash
# ⚠️ CRITICAL: Never read just one document for status queries

# Find ALL related documents:
glob_file_search('**/*[topic]*.md')
glob_file_search('**/*[topic]*plan*.md')
glob_file_search('**/*[topic]*complete*.md')
glob_file_search('**/*[topic]*progress*.md')
glob_file_search('**/*[topic]*status*.md')
glob_file_search('**/*[topic]*summary*.md')

# Read ALL found documents, then synthesize comprehensive answer
```

**Example:**
```
User: "Where are we with week 1 of plan X?"

❌ WRONG: Read week_1_plan.md only
✅ RIGHT: Find and read ALL:
  - week_1_plan.md
  - week_1_complete.md
  - week_1_progress.md
  - week_1_status.md
  
Then synthesize comprehensive answer.
```

## 📚 Key Documentation

- **Entry Point:** `docs/plans/methodology/START_HERE_NEW_TASK.md` (read at start of EVERY task)
- **Quick Reference:** `docs/plans/methodology/SESSION_START_CHECKLIST.md`
- **Full Methodology:** `docs/plans/methodology/DEVELOPMENT_METHODOLOGY.md`
- **Master Plan:** `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md` (THE execution plan - single source of truth)
- **Master Plan Tracker:** `docs/MASTER_PLAN_TRACKER.md` (registry of all plans)
- **Master Plan System:** `.cursorrules_master_plan` (automated workflow for new features)
- **SPOTS Philosophy:** `docs/plans/philosophy_implementation/SPOTS_PHILOSOPHY_AND_ARCHITECTURE.md` (CRITICAL - all work must align)
- **Development Guide:** `README_DEVELOPMENT.md`

---

## 🤖 Master Plan System Integration

**When user says "I want to add [feature]" or "I want to implement [feature]":**

**Follow the automated workflow in:** `.cursorrules_master_plan`

**Key Steps:**
1. Create comprehensive plan document
2. Create plan folder with supporting docs
3. Add to Master Plan Tracker
4. Analyze for Master Plan integration (dependencies, priority, catch-up opportunities)
5. Insert into Master Plan at optimal position
6. Update execution sequence

**See:** `.cursorrules_master_plan` for complete automated workflow

## ⚡ Context Gathering is Mandatory

**Time Investment:** 40 minutes  
**Time Saved:** 50-90% (hours to days)  
**Proven ROI:** Multiple 99% time savings in actual implementations

**DO NOT skip context gathering to "save time" - it costs more later.**

## 🎨 Project-Specific Rules

### Design Tokens (100% Adherence Required)
- ✅ ALWAYS use `AppColors` or `AppTheme` for colors
- ❌ NEVER use direct `Colors.*` (will be flagged)
- This is non-negotiable per user memory

### Architecture
- System is **ai2ai only** (never p2p)
- All device interactions through personality learning AI
- AIs must always be self-improving (individual, network, ecosystem)

### Code Standards
- Zero linter errors before completion
- Full integration (users can access features)
- Tests written
- Documentation complete

### Philosophy
- **CRITICAL:** Reference `docs/plans/philosophy_implementation/SPOTS_PHILOSOPHY_AND_ARCHITECTURE.md` for core philosophy
- **Core Principle:** "Doors, not badges" - Authentic contributions, not gamification
- Never delete unused code (may be setup for future)
- Auto-generated docs are NOT deletable
- All work must align with SPOTS philosophy

## 🚨 Critical Warnings

**STOP and clarify if:**
- [ ] Can't find main plan document
- [ ] Task conflicts with existing plan
- [ ] Multiple plans with contradictory specs
- [ ] Unclear where code should be placed
- [ ] Can't determine dependencies
- [ ] Found existing implementation but specs differ

**DO NOT proceed until clarified.**

---

## ✅ Before Starting ANY Implementation

**Confirm ALL of these (MANDATORY):**
- [ ] I have read START_HERE_NEW_TASK.md (docs/plans/methodology/START_HERE_NEW_TASK.md)
- [ ] I have read DOORS.md (docs/plans/philosophy_implementation/DOORS.md) - MANDATORY
- [ ] I have read OUR_GUTS.md - MANDATORY
- [ ] I have read SPOTS Philosophy (docs/plans/philosophy_implementation/SPOTS_PHILOSOPHY_AND_ARCHITECTURE.md) - MANDATORY
- [ ] I have read Development Methodology (docs/plans/methodology/DEVELOPMENT_METHODOLOGY.md) - MANDATORY
- [ ] I have checked Master Plan (docs/MASTER_PLAN.md) for execution sequence
- [ ] I have checked Master Plan Tracker (docs/MASTER_PLAN_TRACKER.md) for all plans
- [ ] I have discovered ALL relevant plans (in docs/plans/ folders)
- [ ] I have filtered plans by recency + relevance
- [ ] I have read high-priority related plans
- [ ] I have answered doors questions (What doors? When ready? Good key? Learning?)
- [ ] I have checked for conflicts
- [ ] I have searched for existing implementations
- [ ] I understand the architecture (ai2ai only, offline-first, self-improving)
- [ ] I have created a TODO list
- [ ] I have communicated my plan to user
- [ ] User has approved the approach

**If ANY checkbox is unchecked, DO NOT START CODING.**

**If ANY checkbox is unchecked, DO NOT START CODING.**

## 📊 Success Metrics (Proven)

Following this protocol:
- Phase 1 Integration: 40 min → Saved 5 days (99%)
- Optional Enhancements: 30 min → Saved 3 days (85%)
- Phase 2.1: 20 min → Saved 11 days (99.5%)

**NOT following this protocol:**
- Risk duplicating existing work
- Risk wrong architecture/placement
- 2-10x longer implementation time

## 🎯 The Golden Rule

```
40 minutes of context gathering
saves
40 hours of implementation

ALWAYS invest the 40 minutes.
```
