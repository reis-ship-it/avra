## 🚪 Philosophy: "Doors, Not Badges"

> **"There is no secret to life. Just doors that haven't been opened yet."**

AVRA is **the key** that helps you open those doors. Every spot is a door:
- To experiences
- To communities  
- To people
- To meaning
- To more doors

**The Journey:** Spots → Community → Life

You discover your favorite spots, those spots have communities, those communities have events, and through AVRA, you find your people and enrich your life.

**AVRA just provides access. You decide which doors to open.**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (3.8+)
- Dart SDK (3.6+)
- Python 3.8+ (for ML tools)
- iOS/Android development environment

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/reis-ship-it/AVRA.git
cd AVRA
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
```bash
# Copy example config files and add your API keys
cp supabase_config.example lib/supabase_config.dart
# Edit lib/supabase_config.dart with your Supabase credentials
# Edit lib/google_places_config.dart with your Google Places API key
# Edit lib/weather_config.dart with your weather API key
```

4. **Run the app:**
```bash

```

### ML Model Setup (Optional)

AVRA uses ONNX models for AI2AI functionality:

```bash
./scripts/ml/setup_models.sh
```

The setup script will:
1. Download pre-trained models if available
2. Generate models if download fails
3. Verify model integrity

For manual setup, see [`assets/models/README.md`](assets/models/README.md).
