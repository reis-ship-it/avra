# docs/_archive/

This folder contains **archived, non-core** artifacts that are valuable to keep, but should not dominate the “product surface” of the repo.

## What belongs here

- Historical reports, audits, and one-off session outputs
- Prior drafts and older documentation sets that are still useful for reference
- Large documentation bundles that are not part of daily development flow

## What does NOT belong here

- Current canonical plans/specs (those stay in `docs/plans/`)
- Current protocols and agent docs (those stay in `docs/agents/`)
- Generated build artifacts (those should be ignored and never tracked)
