## 📋 **Why Migrated?**

The VIBE_CODING folder was almost entirely AI2AI-focused and overlapped significantly with the new organized structure. Consolidating into `docs/ai2ai/` provides:

1. **Single Source of Truth** - All AI2AI docs in one place
2. **Better Organization** - Clear, numbered folder structure
3. **Easier Navigation** - Progressive complexity (philosophy → implementation)
4. **Reduced Duplication** - No conflicting documentation
5. **Clearer References** - Unified code references

## 🔄 **Migration Details**

See the migration plan: [`docs/ai2ai/VIBE_CODING_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`](../docs/ai2ai/VIBE_CODING_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)

---

## ⚠️ **Note**

This folder is kept for reference but is **no longer actively maintained**. All new documentation should be added to `docs/ai2ai/`.
