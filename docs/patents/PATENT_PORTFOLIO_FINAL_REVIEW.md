12. ✅ Patent #30: Quantum Atomic Clock System (theorems documented)
13. ✅ Patent #31: Topological Knot Theory (theorems documented)

**Patents Marked "Not Required":**
- 18 patents marked as not requiring mathematical proofs
- These patents focus on system architecture, implementation, or business logic rather than mathematical formulas

**Note:** Patent #30 and #31 have mathematical foundations documented in their patent documents.

### **Marketing Validation: 17.2% Complete**
**Patents with Marketing Validation:**
1. ✅ Patent #1: Quantum Compatibility (Business validation)
2. ✅ Patent #5: 12D Personality Multi-Factor (Marketing validation)
3. ✅ Patent #8: Hyper-Personalized Recommendation (Marketing validation)
4. ✅ Patent #25: Calling Score Calculation (Marketing validation)

**Note:** Marketing validation is primarily relevant for patents that directly contribute to user matching, recommendations, or marketing systems. Infrastructure patents (e.g., #11, #21) don't require marketing validation.
