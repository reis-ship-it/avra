## Abstract

A system and method for enabling autonomous AI-to-AI (AI2AI) discovery, communication, and learning without reliance on internet connectivity. The system performs proximity-based peer discovery using local transports, establishes direct device-to-device connections and multi-hop mesh network forwarding, exchanges profile and capability information, computes compatibility locally, and derives learning updates from observed interaction outcomes. The system includes an adaptive mesh networking service that dynamically adjusts message forwarding hop limits based on battery level, network density, message priority, expertise levels, and geographic scope, enabling extended-range learning propagation while maintaining resource efficiency. In some embodiments, the system operates as an offline-first architecture that reduces latency and avoids centralized collection of personal data by keeping computation and storage on-device while permitting privacy-aware exchange of limited representations needed for compatibility and learning. The approach enables continuous learning and network formation in connectivity-constrained environments through both direct peer-to-peer connections and adaptive multi-hop mesh routing.

---

## Background

Many AI learning systems depend on centralized servers for discovery, synchronization, and model updates. These architectures can fail under intermittent connectivity and may increase privacy risk by requiring sensitive user data to transit or be stored in the cloud. Additionally, cloud-mediated learning can introduce latency that delays adaptation and personalization.

Accordingly, there is a need for offline-first AI systems that can discover peers, exchange information, compute compatibility, and learn directly on-device using peer-to-peer communication while preserving privacy and maintaining robust operation without internet access.

---

## Summary

A fully autonomous peer-to-peer AI learning system that works completely offline, enabling personal AIs to discover, connect, exchange personality profiles, calculate compatibility, and learn from each other without internet connectivity. The system includes an adaptive mesh networking architecture that enables multi-hop message forwarding with dynamically adjusted hop limits based on battery level, network density, message priority, user expertise levels, and geographic scope. This adaptive mesh networking extends the effective range of AI learning propagation beyond direct peer-to-peer connections while maintaining resource efficiency and ensuring core functionality (direct connections) always remains available. This system solves critical privacy and connectivity problems by enabling AI learning without cloud dependency or privacy compromise, while extending learning reach through intelligent mesh routing.

## Detailed Description

### Implementation Notes (Non-Limiting)

- In privacy-preserving embodiments, the system minimizes exposure of user-linked identifiers and may exchange anonymized and/or differentially private representations rather than raw user data.
- In AI2AI embodiments, on-device agents may exchange limited, privacy-scoped information with peer agents to coordinate matching, learning, or inference without requiring centralized disclosure of personal identifiers.
- In quantum-state embodiments, the system may represent multi-dimensional profiles as quantum state vectors (e.g., |ψ⟩) and compute similarity using an inner product, distance metric, or other quantum-inspired measure.

### Core Innovation
The system implements a fully autonomous peer-to-peer AI learning architecture that operates completely offline using Bluetooth/NSD device discovery and direct device-to-device communication. The architecture further includes an adaptive mesh networking system that enables multi-hop message forwarding through intermediate devices, extending network reach beyond direct Bluetooth/NSD range. Unlike cloud-dependent AI systems, this architecture enables personal AIs to discover nearby devices, exchange personality profiles, calculate compatibility locally, generate learning insights, and evolve immediately—all without internet connectivity. The adaptive mesh networking component dynamically adjusts hop limits based on device conditions (battery level, network density) and message characteristics (priority, type, expertise level, geographic scope), ensuring optimal network utilization while preserving device resources.

### Problem Solved
- **Cloud Dependency:** Traditional AI learning systems require cloud infrastructure
- **Privacy Concerns:** Cloud-based learning exposes personal data
- **Connectivity Issues:** Rural areas, network outages, or privacy-sensitive contexts prevent AI learning

- **User Control:** Users can disable cloud sync

#### 12. Network Intelligence Integration
- **Enhanced Learning:** When online, receives network-wide pattern recognition
- **Collective Intelligence:** Enhanced learning from global network
- **Optional Enhancement:** Cloud intelligence enhances but doesn't replace offline learning
- **Fallback:** System always works offline even if cloud unavailable

### Phase F: Adaptive Mesh Networking

#### 13. Multi-Hop Message Forwarding
- **Mesh Architecture:** Messages can be forwarded through multiple intermediate devices (hops) to extend learning propagation range
- **Hop Count Tracking:** Each forwarded message includes a hop count indicating the number of intermediate devices it has traversed
- **Origin Tracking:** Messages track their origin device ID to prevent loops and ensure proper routing
- **Guaranteed Direct Connections:** System always maintains at least direct connections (0 hops minimum) to ensure core functionality

#### 14. Adaptive Hop Limit Policy
- **Battery-Based Scaling:** Hop limits dynamically adjust based on device battery level:
  - Charging/Full: Up to 50+ base hops (can go unlimited)
  - Battery ≥80%: 20 hops
  - Battery ≥60%: 15 hops
  - Battery ≥45%: 10 hops
  - Battery ≥30%: 5 hops
  - Battery ≥20%: 3 hops
  - Battery ≥10%: 1 hop
  - Battery <10%: 0 hops (direct only, but still functional)
- **Network Density Bonus:** Additional hops allowed based on nearby device count:
  - ≥20 devices: +10 hops
  - ≥10 devices: +5 hops
  - ≥5 devices: +2 hops
  - <5 devices: 0 bonus
- **Power Saver Mode:** When OS battery saver is active, limits to direct connections only (0 hops) except for critical messages (1 hop allowed)
- **Unlimited Hops:** When conditions are optimal (charging/full battery ≥80%, dense network ≥10 devices, not in power saver), system allows unlimited hops (only TTL/quality limits apply)

#### 15. Message Priority and Type Adjustments
- **Priority Levels:** Four priority levels affect hop limits:
  - Critical: +15 hops bonus, can exceed base limits
  - High: +5 hops bonus
  - Medium: Base limit (no bonus)
  - Low: -2 hops (reduced hops)
- **Message Types:** Different message types have different propagation characteristics:
  - Learning Insights: +10 hops bonus (can propagate far)
  - Personality Discovery: Time-sensitive, standard hops
  - Compatibility Check: Immediate, standard hops
  - Network Coordination: Standard hops
  - Locality Agent Updates: High priority, geographic scope affects hops
  - Locality Personality Updates: Standard hops

#### 16. Expertise-Based Routing
- **Expertise Levels:** User expertise levels (Local, City, Regional, National, Global, Universal) affect routing:
  - Base Expertise Bonus (in expertiseBonus): Expertise index × 2 hops (e.g., City=+2, Regional=+4, National=+6, Global=+8, Universal=+10)
  - Learning from Higher Expertise: +3 hops bonus when learning from higher expertise level (added to expertiseBonus)
  - Expert Message Priority (in priorityBonus): City+ experts get additional priority boost (expertise index added to priorityBonus)
  - Critical Expert Messages: Critical messages from experts get extra boost (expertise index × 2 added to priorityBonus, in addition to base +15 for critical)
  - Global+ Expert Unlimited: Global+ experts can have unlimited hops with relaxed conditions (battery ≥60%, density ≥5)

#### 17. Geographic Scope-Based Routing
- **Scope Levels:** Geographic scope affects hop limits (applied AFTER primary hop limit calculation):
  - Locality: Base hops (no bonus, scopeBonus = 0)
  - City: +2 hops (scopeBonus = +2)
  - Region: +5 hops (scopeBonus = +5)
  - Country: +10 hops (scopeBonus = +10)
  - Global: Unlimited hops (overrides baseLimit, returns null)
- **Scope Integration:** Geographic scope bonuses are additive to the base limit calculated from primary formula: `effectiveMaxHops = baseLimit + scopeBonus`
- **Critical Scope Messages:** Critical priority messages can exceed scoped limits by +10 hops: `effectiveMaxHops = scopedLimit + 10`

#### 18. Adaptive Mesh Service Operation
- **Periodic Adaptation:** Hop limits re-evaluated every 2 minutes and on battery state changes
- **Network Density Updates:** Service receives network density updates when devices are discovered or lost
- **Message Forwarding Decision:** Before forwarding a message, service checks:
  - Current hop count vs. adaptive limit
  - Message priority and type
  - Sender and recipient expertise levels
  - Geographic scope (if applicable)
  - Returns boolean decision: forward (true) or drop (false)
- **Guarantee:** Always allows direct connections (0 hops) regardless of conditions

#### 19. Mesh Forwarding Implementation
- **Learning Insight Forwarding:** Learning insights can be forwarded through mesh network with hop count tracking
- **Locality Agent Updates:** Locality agent updates forwarded with geographic scope consideration
- **Best-Effort Forwarding:** System forwards to up to 2 nearby devices (best-effort, not guaranteed)
- **Loop Prevention:** Origin ID tracking prevents forwarding messages back to origin device
- **Deduplication:** Message IDs and TTL prevent duplicate processing of same message

#### 20. Mesh Networking Formula

**Primary Hop Limit Calculation:**
```
totalHops = baseHops + densityBonus + priorityBonus + expertiseBonus

where:
- baseHops: Battery-based hops (0-50)
  - Charging/Full: 50
  - Battery ≥80%: 20
  - Battery ≥60%: 15
  - Battery ≥45%: 10
  - Battery ≥30%: 5
  - Battery ≥20%: 3
  - Battery ≥10%: 1
  - Battery <10%: 0

- densityBonus: Network density bonus (0-10)
  - ≥20 devices: +10
  - ≥10 devices: +5
  - ≥5 devices: +2
  - <5 devices: 0

- priorityBonus: Priority and message type adjustments (-2 to +15+)
  - Message type: learningInsight → +10
  - Priority: critical → +15, high → +5, medium → 0, low → -2
  - Expertise priority boost: expertiseIndex (Local=0, City=1, Regional=2, etc.)
  - Critical expert boost: expertiseIndex × 2 (for critical messages from experts)

- expertiseBonus: Expertise-based routing bonus (0-10+)
  - Base: expertiseIndex × 2 (Local=0, City=2, Regional=4, National=6, Global=8, Universal=10)
  - Learning bonus: +3 when learning from higher expertise level

Final hop limit = max(0, totalHops)  // Guarantees at least 0 hops (direct connections)

Unlimited hops (null) when:
  (batteryState == charging || full) && batteryLevel >= 80 && 
  networkDensity >= 10 && !powerSaverMode
  OR (for Global+ experts): batteryLevel >= 60 && networkDensity >= 5
```

**Geographic Scope Adjustment (Applied After Base Calculation):**
```
effectiveMaxHops = baseLimit + scopeBonus

where:
- baseLimit: Result from primary hop limit calculation (or null for unlimited)
- scopeBonus: Geographic scope bonus
  - Locality: 0
  - City: +2
  - Region: +5
  - Country: +10
  - Global: null (unlimited, overrides baseLimit)

Critical messages can exceed scoped limit by +10 hops:
  if (priority == critical) {
    effectiveMaxHops = scopedLimit + 10
  }
```

**Mathematical Verification:**
- All calculations use integer arithmetic
- Minimum guarantee: max(0, totalHops) ensures at least 0 hops (direct connections)
- Maximum: Can be unlimited (null) when conditions are optimal
- Geographic scope is additive to base limit (not part of primary formula)
- Critical messages can exceed limits by +10 hops at both base and scope levels

## Adaptive Mesh Networking Integration

**Date:** January 3, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ Integrated

### Overview
This patent has been enhanced with adaptive mesh networking integration, enabling extended network reach beyond direct Bluetooth/NSD range through intelligent multi-hop message forwarding. The mesh networking system dynamically adjusts hop limits based on device conditions (battery level, network density) and message characteristics (priority, type, expertise level, geographic scope), ensuring optimal network utilization while preserving device resources.

### Mesh Networking Integration Points
- **Message Forwarding:** Learning insights and locality agent updates can be forwarded through intermediate devices
- **Adaptive Hop Limits:** Hop limits calculated dynamically based on battery, density, priority, expertise, and scope
- **Battery-Aware Routing:** System scales back hop limits when battery is low to preserve device resources
- **Network Density Awareness:** System increases hop limits when network is dense (more reliable routing)
- **Expertise-Based Routing:** Higher expertise levels and learning from experts receive additional hops
- **Geographic Scope Routing:** Different geographic scopes (locality, city, region, country, global) receive appropriate hop allocations
- **Guarantee:** System always maintains at least direct connections (0 hops minimum) to ensure core functionality

### Benefits of Adaptive Mesh Networking
1. **Extended Network Reach:** Messages can propagate beyond direct Bluetooth/NSD range through intermediate devices
2. **Resource Efficiency:** System automatically scales back when battery is low or network is sparse
3. **Intelligent Routing:** Higher priority messages and valuable learning signals from experts receive extended reach
4. **Geographic Awareness:** System adjusts reach based on message geographic scope
5. **Reliability:** Guarantees at least direct connections even in worst-case conditions

### Implementation Requirements
- All mesh forwarding MUST check adaptive hop limits before forwarding
- Hop count MUST be incremented in forwarded messages
- Origin identifier MUST be tracked to prevent loops
- System MUST re-adapt hop limits periodically and on state changes
- System MUST guarantee at least 0 hops (direct connections) minimum
