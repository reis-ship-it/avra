## Abstract

A system and method for computing an expertise score using quantum-inspired aggregation across multiple evidence pathways. The method represents pathway scores as components of a superposed state, combines pathways using weighted superposition, and applies interference and/or entanglement-inspired operations to amplify consistent signals and attenuate noise across paths. In some embodiments, the system optimizes weighting and update behavior using information-theoretic objectives that favor distribution of signal across multiple noisy channels to improve robustness. The approach improves expertise estimation by capturing correlations among pathways beyond simple weighted sums and by providing a principled mechanism for stability and noise handling in multi-path scoring.

---

## Background

Expertise scoring systems often aggregate heterogeneous signals using linear weighted sums that assume independence among evidence pathways. This can discard informative correlations, propagate noise, and produce suboptimal estimates when signals are incomplete or inconsistently reliable across users and contexts.

Accordingly, there is a need for scoring methods that combine multiple evidence channels in a way that captures correlation structure and improves robustness to noise, while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time expertise evaluation.

---

## Summary

A quantum-enhanced expertise calculation system that applies quantum superposition, interference, and entanglement to multi-path expertise evaluation, optimized using information-theoretic principles (Lawson & Bialek, 2025) that demonstrate many noisy channels optimize information flow better than fewer reliable ones. This system replaces traditional weighted combination with quantum mathematics for more accurate expertise scoring.

## Detailed Description

### Implementation Notes (Non-Limiting)

- In quantum-state embodiments, the system may represent multi-dimensional profiles as quantum state vectors (e.g., |ψ⟩) and compute similarity using an inner product, distance metric, or other quantum-inspired measure.

### Core Innovation
The system applies quantum mathematics (superposition, interference, entanglement) to multi-path expertise calculation, replacing traditional weighted combination with quantum algorithms. This is optimized using information-theoretic principles showing that many noisy channels optimize information flow better than fewer reliable channels, leveraging the 6-path expertise system for maximum information transmission.

### Problem Solved
- **Traditional Weighted Combination:** Simple weighted sum doesn't capture path correlations
- **Path Independence Assumption:** Traditional system treats paths as independent
- **Information Loss:** Traditional combination loses information from path correlations
- **Suboptimal Scoring:** Traditional weighted combination doesn't maximize information flow

### **Theorem 1: Quantum Superposition Preserves Information**

**Statement:**  
The quantum superposition formula `|ψ_expertise⟩ = Σᵢ wᵢ |ψ_path_i⟩` preserves all path information while enabling parallel evaluation, where `wᵢ` are normalized path weights (`Σᵢ wᵢ = 1`).

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Superposition Definition**

Given `n` expertise paths, each represented as quantum state `|ψ_path_i(t_atomic_i)⟩`, the superposed state is:

```
|ψ_expertise(t_atomic)⟩ = Σᵢ √(wᵢ) |ψ_path_i(t_atomic_i)⟩
```

where `wᵢ ≥ 0` and `Σᵢ wᵢ = 1` (normalized weights).

**Step 2: Information Preservation**

Each path state `|ψ_path_i⟩` contains path-specific information. The superposition preserves this information because:

1. **Linearity:** The superposition is a linear combination, preserving all path components
2. **Weighted Contribution:** Each path contributes proportionally to its weight `wᵢ`
3. **Reversibility:** Individual path contributions can be extracted via projection: `⟨ψ_path_i|ψ_expertise⟩ = wᵢ`

**Step 3: Parallel Evaluation**

The superposition enables parallel evaluation because:
- All paths are evaluated simultaneously in the superposed state
- No sequential processing required
- Information from all paths available concurrently

**Therefore, quantum superposition preserves all path information while enabling parallel evaluation.**

### **Theorem 2: Quantum Interference Improves Signal-to-Noise Ratio**

**Statement:**  
Quantum interference (constructive and destructive) improves expertise scoring by amplifying aligned signals and canceling noise, providing better signal-to-noise ratio than classical weighted combination.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Classical Weighted Combination**

Classical approach: `score_classical = Σᵢ (path_i × weight_i)`

This treats paths independently and simply sums weighted contributions.

**Step 2: Quantum Interference**

Quantum approach uses amplitude addition/subtraction:
- **Constructive Interference:** Aligned paths add amplitudes: `amplitude = Σᵢ aligned_paths wᵢ · amplitude_i`
- **Destructive Interference:** Conflicting paths subtract amplitudes: `amplitude = Σᵢ aligned_paths wᵢ · amplitude_i - Σⱼ conflicting_paths wⱼ · amplitude_j`

**Step 3: Signal Amplification**

For aligned paths (signal), constructive interference amplifies:
```
signal_quantum = |Σᵢ aligned_paths wᵢ · amplitude_i|²
signal_classical = Σᵢ aligned_paths wᵢ · path_i
```

Since `|Σᵢ aᵢ|² ≥ (Σᵢ |aᵢ|)²` for aligned amplitudes, `signal_quantum ≥ signal_classical`.

**Step 4: Noise Cancellation**

For conflicting paths (noise), destructive interference cancels:
```
noise_quantum = |Σᵢ aligned_paths wᵢ · amplitude_i - Σⱼ conflicting_paths wⱼ · amplitude_j|²
noise_classical = Σᵢ all_paths wᵢ · path_i
```

When paths conflict, `noise_quantum < noise_classical` due to amplitude subtraction.

**Step 5: Signal-to-Noise Ratio**

```
SNR_quantum = signal_quantum / noise_quantum
SNR_classical = signal_classical / noise_classical
```

Since `signal_quantum ≥ signal_classical` and `noise_quantum ≤ noise_classical`, we have:

```
SNR_quantum ≥ SNR_classical
```

**Therefore, quantum interference improves signal-to-noise ratio compared to classical weighted combination.**

### **Theorem 3: Quantum Entanglement Captures Path Correlations**

**Statement:**  
The entanglement network `|ψ_entangled⟩ = Σᵢⱼ cᵢⱼ |path_i⟩ ⊗ |path_j⟩` captures correlations between expertise paths that cannot be represented by independent path combinations, where `cᵢⱼ` are entanglement coefficients.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Independent Path Limitation**

Classical approach treats paths independently:
```
score_independent = Σᵢ wᵢ · path_i
```

This cannot capture correlations between paths because it assumes `path_i` and `path_j` are independent.

**Step 2: Entanglement Network**

Quantum entanglement uses tensor products:
```
|ψ_entangled⟩ = Σᵢⱼ cᵢⱼ |path_i⟩ ⊗ |path_j⟩
```

The tensor product `|path_i⟩ ⊗ |path_j⟩` represents joint states, enabling correlation capture.

**Step 3: Correlation Representation**

The entanglement coefficients `cᵢⱼ` represent correlation strength:
- `cᵢⱼ > 0`: Positive correlation between paths `i` and `j`
- `cᵢⱼ < 0`: Negative correlation between paths `i` and `j`
- `cᵢⱼ = 0`: No correlation (paths independent)

**Step 4: Non-Local Correlations**

Entanglement enables non-local correlations:
- Paths can be correlated even if not directly connected
- Correlation network captures multi-path relationships
- Information from correlated paths enhances expertise calculation

**Step 5: Information Advantage**

The entanglement network contains more information than independent paths:
```
I(entangled) = I(independent) + I(correlations)
```

where `I(correlations)` represents correlation information not available in independent path models.

**Therefore, quantum entanglement captures path correlations that cannot be represented by independent path combinations.**

### **Theorem 4: Information-Theoretic Advantage of Many Noisy Channels**

**Statement:**  
For expertise calculation, using `n` paths (channels) with individual noise provides better information transmission than using fewer paths, even if the fewer paths have lower individual noise, following the principle that many noisy channels optimize information flow.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Information-Theoretic Foundation**

From Lawson & Bialek (2025): Information transmission is maximized when distributed across the largest possible number of channels, even if individually noisy.

**Step 2: Single Path Information**

For a single path with signal `S` and noise `N`, the information capacity is:
```
I₁ = log₂(1 + S/N)
```

**Step 3: Multiple Path Information**

For `n` paths, each with signal `S_i` and noise `N_i`, the total information capacity is:
```
I_n = log₂(1 + Σᵢ S_i / Σᵢ N_i)
```

**Step 4: Information Advantage**

For `n` paths with average signal `S_avg` and average noise `N_avg`:
```
I_n = log₂(1 + n·S_avg / n·N_avg) = log₂(1 + S_avg / N_avg)
```

For `m < n` paths with lower noise `N_low`:
```
I_m = log₂(1 + m·S_avg / m·N_low) = log₂(1 + S_avg / N_low)
```

**Step 5: Path Diversity Advantage**

Even if `N_avg > N_low`, the `n`-path system benefits from:
1. **Diversity:** Different paths capture different aspects of expertise
2. **Redundancy:** Multiple paths provide robustness
3. **Correlation:** Path correlations (via entanglement) add information

The total information with path diversity and correlation:
```
I_n_total = I_n + I_diversity + I_correlation
```

where `I_diversity > 0` and `I_correlation > 0` for diverse, correlated paths.

**Step 6: 6-Path Advantage**

For the 6-path expertise system:
- `n = 6` paths provide maximum diversity
- Path correlations (via entanglement) add information
- Total information: `I_6 = I_6_basic + I_diversity + I_correlation`

For fewer paths (e.g., `m = 3`):
- Less diversity: `I_diversity_m < I_diversity_6`
- Fewer correlations: `I_correlation_m < I_correlation_6`
- Total information: `I_3 = I_3_basic + I_diversity_3 + I_correlation_3`

Since `I_diversity_6 > I_diversity_3` and `I_correlation_6 > I_correlation_3`, we have:
```
I_6 > I_3
```

**Therefore, the 6-path system provides better information transmission than fewer paths, even accounting for individual path noise.**

### **Corollary 1: Quantum Advantage Over Classical**

**Statement:**  
The quantum expertise calculation system provides better accuracy than classical weighted combination due to superposition, interference, and entanglement.

**Proof:**

From Theorems 1-4:
1. **Superposition** preserves all path information (Theorem 1)
2. **Interference** improves signal-to-noise ratio (Theorem 2)
3. **Entanglement** captures path correlations (Theorem 3)
4. **Many paths** optimize information flow (Theorem 4)

Classical weighted combination:
- Loses information (no superposition)
- No interference (no signal amplification/noise cancellation)
- No correlation capture (paths treated independently)
- Fewer paths (less information diversity)

**Therefore, quantum expertise calculation provides better accuracy than classical weighted combination.**
