# SPOTS vs Traditional Marketing Experiment Plan

**Date:** December 21, 2025  
**Status:** 📋 Planning Phase  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive A/B test comparing SPOTS AI targeting vs traditional event marketing techniques  
**Timeline:** Single-phase experiment with 6-month simulation

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This experiment validates that SPOTS' AI-powered marketing systems (quantum compatibility, hyper-personalized recommendations, 12D personality matching) significantly outperform traditional event marketing techniques (social media ads, email campaigns, paid search, organic marketing) in terms of:

- **Attendance Rates** (target: ≥2x improvement)
- **Conversion Rates** (target: ≥4x improvement)
- **Revenue per Event** (target: ≥2x improvement)
- **Cost per Acquisition** (target: ≤50% of traditional)
- **ROI** (target: ≥2x improvement)

**Success Criteria:** SPOTS must demonstrate statistically significant (p < 0.01) improvements across all primary metrics with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 1.0).

**Implementation:**
- Calculate quantum compatibility between user and event host
- Filter users with compatibility ≥ 0.70
- Rank by compatibility score (highest first)
- Target top 20% of compatible users

### B. Hyper-Personalized Recommendations (Patent #20)

**Technology:**

- Weighted compatibility: 60% dimension + 20% energy + 20% exploration
- Conversion rate: 18-28% (matched → tickets)

**Implementation:**
- Calculate dimension compatibility (60% weight)
- Calculate energy compatibility (20% weight)
- Calculate exploration compatibility (20% weight)
- Combined weighted score for matching

### D. Calling Score Calculation (Patent #22)

**Technology:**

- Conversion rate: 12-22% (called → tickets)

**Implementation:**
- Calculate calling score (vibe compatibility)
- Filter users with calling score ≥ 0.70
- Context-aware recommendations based on location/time

### SPOTS Marketing Benchmarks (Expected):

- **Overall Conversion Rate:** 15-25% (recommendations → tickets)
