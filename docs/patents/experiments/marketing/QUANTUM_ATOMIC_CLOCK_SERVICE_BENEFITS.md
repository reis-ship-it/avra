**Atomic Clock Synchronization:**
```
t_atomic_device = t_atomic_server + offset_device

Where:

- offset_device = Device offset (calculated and tracked)
- Synchronization accuracy: 99.9%+ across all devices
```

**Standard Timestamp Synchronization:**
```
t_device = t_server + estimated_offset

Where:
- t_server = Server timestamp
- estimated_offset = Estimated offset (less accurate)
- Synchronization accuracy: Variable, potential drift
```

**Metrics:**

Where:
- t_atomic_i = Atomic timestamp for node i
- All nodes synchronized to atomic clock
- Network-wide consistency: High
```

**Standard Timestamp Network State:**
```
|ψ_network(t)⟩ = (1/N) Σᵢ |ψ_node_i(t_i)⟩

- Compare with UTC-only operations

**Atomic Clock Service with Timezone:**
```
AtomicTimestamp {
