## Key Insights

These scenarios test SPOTS under conditions that favor traditional marketing:
- High budgets (traditional can outspend)
- Mainstream events (broad reach works)
- Established hosts (reputation matters)
- Long lead times (traditional needs time)
- Large markets (traditional can reach more)
- Simple demographics (traditional targeting works)

**Question:** Can SPOTS still compete or outperform when traditional has advantages?
