## Key Insights

These scenarios test SPOTS against aggressive marketing techniques:
- Data harvesting and extensive user profiling
- Privacy-invasive tracking (cookies, fingerprinting, cross-platform)

- Micro-targeting with extensive user data
- Psychological manipulation (social proof, price anchoring)

**Question:** Can SPOTS still outperform even when competitors use aggressive, privacy-invasive, or manipulative techniques?
