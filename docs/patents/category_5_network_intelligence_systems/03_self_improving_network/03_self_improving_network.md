    final successFactors = _analyzeSuccessFactors(
      myProfile,
      otherProfile,
      outcome,
    );
    
    // Update personality based on successful patterns
    if (outcome.isSuccessful) {
      await _reinforceSuccessfulPatterns(successFactors);
    } else {
      await _learnFromUnsuccessfulPatterns(successFactors);
    }
    
    // Update connection preferences
    await _updateConnectionPreferences(successFactors);
  }
  
  Map<String, double> _analyzeSuccessFactors(
    PersonalityProfile myProfile,
    PersonalityProfile otherProfile,
    ConnectionOutcome outcome,
  ) {

    // Analyze patterns
    final compatibilityPatterns = _analyzeCompatibilityPatterns(aggregateData);
    final successPatterns = _analyzeSuccessPatterns(aggregateData);
    final learningPatterns = _analyzeLearningPatterns(aggregateData);
    
    return NetworkPatterns(

      successPatterns: successPatterns,
      learningPatterns: learningPatterns,
      networkIntelligence: _calculateNetworkIntelligence(),
    );
  }
  
  Future<AggregateData> _collectAggregateData() async {
    // Only collect aggregate statistics, never individual data
    return AggregateData(
      averageCompatibilityScores: await _getAverageCompatibility(),
      successRateByCompatibilityRange: await _getSuccessRates(),
      learningInsightsByCategory: await _getLearningInsights(),

    // Identify emerging patterns
    final emergingPatterns = _identifyEmergingPatterns(individualInsights);
    
    // Generate collective recommendations
    final recommendations = _generateCollectiveRecommendations(
      emergingPatterns,
    );
    
    return CollectiveInsights(
      emergingPatterns: emergingPatterns,
      recommendations: recommendations,
      networkIntelligence: _calculateNetworkIntelligence(),
      confidence: _calculateConfidence(individualInsights),
    );
  }

    // Differential privacy noise
    final noisyData = _applyDifferentialPrivacy(individualData);
    
    // Aggregate only (no individual data)
    final aggregateStats = _calculateAggregateStats(noisyData);
    
    // Validate privacy preservation
    _validatePrivacyPreservation(aggregateStats);
    
    return aggregateStats;
  }
  
  List<IndividualData> _applyDifferentialPrivacy(
    List<IndividualData> data,
  ) {
    // Add noise to protect individual privacy
    return data.map((item) => _addNoise(item)).toList();
  }
  
  AggregateStats _calculateAggregateStats(
    List<IndividualData> noisyData,
  ) {
    // Calculate only aggregate statistics
    return AggregateStats(
      averageCompatibility: _calculateAverage(noisyData),
      successRate: _calculateSuccessRate(noisyData),
      learningRate: _calculateLearningRate(noisyData),
      // Never return individual data points
    );
  }
}
```

**Privacy Techniques:**

    required NetworkPatterns currentPatterns,
  }) async {
    // Analyze outcome
    final outcomeAnalysis = _analyzeOutcome(outcome);
    
    // Update network patterns
    final updatedPatterns = _updatePatterns(
      currentPatterns,
      outcomeAnalysis,
    );
    
    // Improve recommendations
    await _improveRecommendations(updatedPatterns);
    
    // Update collective intelligence
    await _updateCollectiveIntelligence(updatedPatterns);
  }
  
  NetworkPatterns _updatePatterns(
    NetworkPatterns current,
    OutcomeAnalysis analysis,
  ) {
    // Weighted update based on outcome quality
    return NetworkPatterns(
      compatibilityPatterns: _updateCompatibilityPatterns(
        current.compatibilityPatterns,
        analysis,
      ),
      successPatterns: _updateSuccessPatterns(
        current.successPatterns,
        analysis,
      ),
      learningPatterns: _updateLearningPatterns(
        current.learningPatterns,
        analysis,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Feedback Loop:**
1. Connection outcomes → Outcome analysis
2. Outcome analysis → Pattern updates
3. Pattern updates → Recommendation improvements
4. Recommendation improvements → Better connections
5. Better connections → Improved outcomes (loop continues)
