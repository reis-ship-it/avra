# Patent Attorney Cover Sheet (Template)

**Purpose:** One-page triage sheet per invention so counsel can quickly (1) understand the invention, (2) choose claim strategy, and (3) identify missing pieces.

## Patent Identifier

- **Working title**:
- **Internal patent number**: (e.g., #1, #21, #31)
- **Category**:
- **Tier / priority**:
- **Target filing type**: Provisional / Non‑provisional / Continuation / Divisional (TBD by counsel)

---

## One‑Sentence Invention Summary

> (One sentence. No marketing. Focus on the technical mechanism.)

---

## Problem → Solution (2–4 bullets)

- **Problem**:
- **Why existing systems fail**:
- **Solution (core mechanism)**:
- **Primary technical benefit**:

---

## What’s the Claim “Center of Gravity”?

Pick 1–2:
- **Method** (process steps)
- **System** (modules + data flow)
- **Non‑transitory computer-readable medium** (if desired)

---

## Core Novelty / Differentiators (vs closest prior art)

List the 3–6 most defensible differentiators.

1.
2.
3.

---

## Broadest Independent Claim Draft (Plain English)

**Independent claim theme:** (e.g., “A method for …”)

- Step/module 1:
- Step/module 2:
- Step/module 3:
- Optional: privacy / offline / timing constraint (if core)

---

## Dependent Claim Ladder (What to ladder)

- **Privacy/security features**:
- **Offline / transport details**:
- **Scoring/math details**:
- **Thresholds / validation checks**:
- **UI/monitoring outputs (if appropriate)**:
- **Performance constraints (only if real + supportable)**:

---

## Drawings Needed (List)

Even if you have diagrams, counsel usually wants a crisp figure plan:

- FIG. 1: System architecture / blocks
- FIG. 2: Core algorithm flow
- FIG. 3: Data structures / state representation
- FIG. 4: Example embodiment / sequence diagram
- FIG. 5: Optional privacy flow / anonymization

---

## Evidence / Validation Notes (Non‑Limiting)

- **Experiments present?** Yes/No
- **Synthetic/simulated?** Yes/No (must be disclosed)
- **Where located**: (paths to evidence)

---

## Engineering Anchors (Optional)

- **Key implementation files (if any)**:
- **Key services / modules**:
- **Key config parameters**:

---

## Risks / Counsel Questions

- **101 risk (abstract idea framing)**: low/med/high (TBD)
- **Obviousness risk**: low/med/high (TBD)
- **Enablement risk**: low/med/high (TBD)
- **What should we NOT say** (avoid marketing promises / guarantees):

## Included Files (Exact Paths)

- **Spec**:
- **Drawings / visuals**:
- **Prior art notes**:
