# Attorney-Ready Patent Documentation Bundle Checklist

**Date:** 2026-01-02  
**Purpose:** Provide a fast, structured package for patent counsel to (1) assess readiness, (2) draft a provisional/non‑provisional, and (3) identify gaps early.

---

## How to Package This for Counsel (Portfolio vs. Per-Patent)

**Do both:**

- **Portfolio bundle (one zip / one folder)**: lets counsel understand the overall system, detect overlap/continuations/divisionals, and design claim strategy across the portfolio.
- **Per‑patent bundle(s)**: lets counsel quickly take one invention from “invention disclosure” → “application-ready” without hunting.

**Recommended submission pattern:**
- Send **one portfolio bundle** plus **a short list of “priority patents”** (Tier 1 first).
- Ask counsel to select **filing grouping strategy** (separate filings vs. combined vs. continuation/divisional plan).

## Per‑Patent Bundle Checklist (Repeat Per Invention)

For each patent you want counsel to actively draft:

- [ ] **Primary spec (single file)**
  - [ ] Main doc in `docs/patents/category_*/*/[name].md`
  - [ ] Contains: Abstract (≤150 words), Background, Summary, Detailed Description, Claims
  - [ ] Contains: Cross‑References, Fed R&D statement, Incorporation by Reference, Definitions, Brief Description of Drawings
- [ ] **Drawings**
  - [ ] `[name]_visuals.md` (or “No drawings” noted in spec)
  - [ ] Figure list present (FIG. 1, FIG. 2, …)
- [ ] **Claims set**
  - [ ] One clear independent claim (method or system)
  - [ ] Dependent claim ladder tied to claim 1 using consistent phrasing
  - [ ] No marketing language; no promises/guarantees
- [ ] **Prior art notes**
  - [ ] Closest 3–10 references with 1–2 sentence distinctions
  - [ ] Candidate IDS list (patents + papers)
- [ ] **Enablement notes**
  - [ ] At least one concrete end‑to‑end example embodiment
  - [ ] Optional: pseudo‑code blocks (non‑limiting) supporting implementation
- [ ] **Evidence / validation (optional)**
  - [ ] Mark all synthetic/simulated results explicitly
  - [ ] Keep evidence in appendix sections or separate experiment docs
- [ ] **Ownership / inventorship inputs (for counsel)**
  - [ ] Named inventors list (draft)
  - [ ] Assignment/ownership expectation (company vs personal)
  - [ ] Any public disclosures dates (talks, posts, releases)

---

## “Attorney Triage” Questions (Answer These Up Front)

- [ ] **What is the single sentence invention?**
- [ ] **What is the core novelty vs closest known art?**
- [ ] **What are the 2–3 broadest claim themes?** (method/system/CRM)
- [ ] **What is the “design-around” risk?**
- [ ] **What does counsel recommend: standalone vs combined vs continuation/divisional?**

---

## Suggested Bundling Priority (Typical)

- **Tier 1 patents** first (strongest, most defensible, highest leverage)
- Next: Tier 2 (fill portfolio breadth, defensive coverage)
- Then: Tier 3/4 (only if strategic or inexpensive provisionals)
