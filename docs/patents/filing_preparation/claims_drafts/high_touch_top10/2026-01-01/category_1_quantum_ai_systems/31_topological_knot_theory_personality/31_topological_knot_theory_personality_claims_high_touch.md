## Optional companion independent claims (counsel may renumber)

- A system comprising one or more processors and memory storing instructions that, when executed, cause the system to perform the method of claim 1.
- A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform the method of claim 1.

## Counsel checklist (quick)
- Confirm statutory class strategy (method/system/CRM) aligns with filing plan.
- Check antecedent basis in Claim 1 (a/the transitions) and dependent claims.
- Remove weak permissive terms in claims ("may", "can") if present.
- Ensure every limitation is supported in `## Detailed Description` and drawings.
