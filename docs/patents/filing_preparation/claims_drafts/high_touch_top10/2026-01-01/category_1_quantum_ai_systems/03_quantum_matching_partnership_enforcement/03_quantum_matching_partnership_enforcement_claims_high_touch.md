## Claim 1 scope options (choose one posture)

### Option A — BROAD

1. A method for quantum-inspired personality matching combined with automated partnership enforcement, comprising:
     (a) Calculating quantum compatibility between business and expert personality states using `C = |⟨ψ_expert|ψ_business⟩|²`;
     (b) Suggesting partnerships above 70% compatibility threshold using weighted formula `score = (vibe × a threshold value) + (expertise × a threshold value) + (location × a threshold value)`;
     (c) Automatically enforcing exclusivity constraints by intercepting event creation and checking against active exclusive partnerships;
     (d) Tracking minimum event requirements using schedule compliance algorithm: `required_events = ceil(progress × minimum_event_count)`;
     (e) Detecting breaches in real-time and applying automatic penalties.

### Option B — MEDIUM (baseline)

1. A method for quantum-inspired personality matching combined with automated partnership enforcement, comprising:
     (a) Calculating quantum compatibility between business and expert personality states using `C = |⟨ψ_expert|ψ_business⟩|²`;
     (b) Suggesting partnerships above 70% compatibility threshold using weighted formula `score = (vibe × 0.5) + (expertise × 0.3) + (location × 0.2)`;
     (c) Automatically enforcing exclusivity constraints by intercepting event creation and checking against active exclusive partnerships;
     (d) Tracking minimum event requirements using schedule compliance algorithm: `required_events = ceil(progress × minimum_event_count)`;
     (e) Detecting breaches in real-time and applying automatic penalties.

### Option C — NARROW (fallback)

1. A method for quantum-inspired personality matching combined with automated partnership enforcement, comprising:
     (a) Calculating quantum compatibility between business and expert personality states using `C = |⟨ψ_expert|ψ_business⟩|²`;
     (b) Suggesting partnerships above 70% compatibility threshold using weighted formula `score = (vibe × 0.5) + (expertise × 0.3) + (location × 0.2)`;
     (c) Automatically enforcing exclusivity constraints by intercepting event creation and checking against active exclusive partnerships;
     (d) Tracking minimum event requirements using schedule compliance algorithm: `required_events = ceil(progress × minimum_event_count)`;
     (e) Detecting breaches in real-time and applying automatic penalties, wherein further comprising quantum-based partnership discovery and enforcement.

## Claims 2+ (baseline from spec; cleaned formatting)

2. An integrated system for business-expert partnership lifecycle management using quantum compatibility matching and automated enforcement, comprising:
  (a) Quantum state vector personality representation for experts and businesses;
  (b) Compatibility calculation via quantum inner product `C = |⟨ψ_expert|ψ_business⟩|²`;
  (c) Partnership formation workflow with negotiation and digital signature integration;
  (d) Real-time exclusivity constraint checking that intercepts event creation;
  (e) Schedule compliance tracking with formulas: `progress = elapsed_days / total_days` and `required_events = ceil(progress × minimum_event_count)`;
  (f) Breach detection with automatic penalty application.

3. The method of claim 1, further comprising quantum-based partnership discovery and enforcement:
  (a) Generating quantum personality states `|ψ_expert⟩` and `|ψ_business⟩` for expert and business;
  (b) Calculating compatibility via `C = |⟨ψ_expert|ψ_business⟩|²`;
  (c) Filtering matches above 70% threshold using weighted formula;
  (d) Creating partnerships with negotiation workflow and pre-event agreement locking;
  (e) Automatically enforcing exclusivity by checking event creation against active partnerships;
  (f) Tracking minimum requirements with schedule compliance algorithm;
  (g) Detecting breaches and applying penalties automatically.

4. An automated partnership ecosystem using quantum matching and enforcement, comprising:
  (a) Quantum compatibility engine calculating `C = |⟨ψ_expert|ψ_business⟩|²`;
  (b) Partnership formation system with negotiation and digital signatures;
  (c) Exclusivity enforcement algorithm that intercepts and validates event creation;
  (d) Minimum event tracking with schedule compliance: `required_events = ceil(progress × minimum_event_count)`;
  (e) Breach detection system with real-time monitoring and automatic penalty application;
  (f) Feedback loop that improves quantum matching based on partnership success.

## Optional companion independent claims (counsel may renumber)

- A system comprising one or more processors and memory storing instructions that, when executed, cause the system to perform the method of claim 1.
- A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform the method of claim 1.

## Counsel checklist (quick)
- Confirm statutory class strategy (method/system/CRM) aligns with filing plan.
- Check antecedent basis in Claim 1 (a/the transitions) and dependent claims.
- Remove weak permissive terms in claims ("may", "can") if present.
- Ensure every limitation is supported in `## Detailed Description` and drawings.
