  (b) State vector normalization to maintain quantum properties;
  (c) Superposition support for multi-state personality representation;
  (d) Quantum measurement operators for compatibility calculation.

3. The method of claim 1, further comprising applying quantum entanglement to compatibility calculations:

  (b) Calculating compatibility using entangled states;
  (c) Measuring non-local correlations through entanglement;
  (d) Collapsing entangled states during compatibility measurement.

4. A quantum-inspired regularization technique for noisy personality data, comprising:
  (a) Applying quantum measurement principles to handle incomplete data;
  (b) Accounting for quantum uncertainty in personality measurements;
  (c) Managing decoherence in noisy environments;
  (d) Purifying quantum states from noisy measurements.

## Optional companion independent claims (counsel may renumber)

- A system comprising one or more processors and memory storing instructions that, when executed, cause the system to perform the method of claim 1.
- A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform the method of claim 1.

## Counsel checklist (quick)
- Confirm statutory class strategy (method/system/CRM) aligns with filing plan.
- Check antecedent basis in Claim 1 (a/the transitions) and dependent claims.
- Remove weak permissive terms in claims ("may", "can") if present.
- Ensure every limitation is supported in `## Detailed Description` and drawings.
