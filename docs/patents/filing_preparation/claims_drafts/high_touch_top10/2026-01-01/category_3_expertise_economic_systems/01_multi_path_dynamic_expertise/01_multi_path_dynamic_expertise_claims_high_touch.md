## Claim 1 scope options (choose one posture)

### Option A — BROAD

1. A method for multi-path expertise recognition with weighted algorithm, comprising:
     (a) Calculating expertise across six paths: Exploration (40%), Credentials (25%), Influence (20%), Professional (25%), Community (15%), Local (varies);
     (b) Combining path scores using weighted formula: `score = (exploration × a threshold value) + (credentials × a threshold value) + (influence × a threshold value) + (professional × a threshold value) + (community × a threshold value) + (local × weight)`;
     (c) Dynamically scaling thresholds based on platform phase, category saturation, and geographic hierarchy;
     (d) Enforcing geographic hierarchy  for expertise scope.

### Option B — MEDIUM (baseline)

1. A method for multi-path expertise recognition with weighted algorithm, comprising:
     (a) Calculating expertise across six paths: Exploration (40%), Credentials (25%), Influence (20%), Professional (25%), Community (15%), Local (varies);
     (b) Combining path scores using weighted formula: `score = (exploration × 0.40) + (credentials × 0.25) + (influence × 0.20) + (professional × 0.25) + (community × 0.15) + (local × weight)`;
     (c) Dynamically scaling thresholds based on platform phase, category saturation, and geographic hierarchy;
     (d) Enforcing geographic hierarchy (Local → City → Regional → National → Global) for expertise scope.

### Option C — NARROW (fallback)

1. A method for multi-path expertise recognition with weighted algorithm, comprising:
     (a) Calculating expertise across six paths: Exploration (40%), Credentials (25%), Influence (20%), Professional (25%), Community (15%), Local (varies);
     (b) Combining path scores using weighted formula: `score = (exploration × 0.40) + (credentials × 0.25) + (influence × 0.20) + (professional × 0.25) + (community × 0.15) + (local × weight)`;
     (c) Dynamically scaling thresholds based on platform phase, category saturation, and geographic hierarchy;
     (d) Enforcing geographic hierarchy (Local → City → Regional → National → Global) for expertise scope, wherein further comprising economic enablement through expertise recognition.

## Claims 2+ (baseline from spec; cleaned formatting)

2. A system for dynamic expertise threshold scaling with economic enablement, comprising:
  (a) Multi-path expertise calculation with six weighted paths;
  (b) Platform phase scaling (bootstrap, growth, scale, mature) adjusting thresholds;
  (c) Category saturation algorithm using 6-factor analysis (supply, quality, utilization, demand, growth, geographic distribution);
  (d) Locality-specific threshold adjustments based on locality values;
  (e) Geographic hierarchy enforcement restricting event hosting to expertise scope.

3. The method of claim 1, further comprising economic enablement through expertise recognition:
  (a) Multi-path expertise calculation enabling diverse forms of expertise recognition;
  (b) Dynamic threshold scaling adapting to platform growth and category saturation;
  (c) Automatic check-in system tracking visits passively (geofencing + Bluetooth/AI2AI);
  (d) Partnership formation requiring expertise threshold with quantum matching;
  (e) Expertise boost feedback loop where partnerships boost expertise enabling more partnerships.

4. An integrated expertise and economic system, comprising:
  (a) Multi-path weighted expertise algorithm (6 paths with specific weights);
  (b) Dynamic threshold scaling with platform phase and category saturation adjustments;
  (c) Automatic passive check-in system with geofencing and Bluetooth/AI2AI verification;
  (d) Geographic hierarchy enforcement (Local → City → Regional → National → Global);
  (e) Partnership formation and revenue distribution enabling economic opportunities;
  (f) Expertise boost feedback loop creating sustainable income streams.

## Optional companion independent claims (counsel may renumber)

- A system comprising one or more processors and memory storing instructions that, when executed, cause the system to perform the method of claim 1.
- A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform the method of claim 1.

## Counsel checklist (quick)
- Confirm statutory class strategy (method/system/CRM) aligns with filing plan.
- Check antecedent basis in Claim 1 (a/the transitions) and dependent claims.
- Remove weak permissive terms in claims ("may", "can") if present.
- Ensure every limitation is supported in `## Detailed Description` and drawings.
