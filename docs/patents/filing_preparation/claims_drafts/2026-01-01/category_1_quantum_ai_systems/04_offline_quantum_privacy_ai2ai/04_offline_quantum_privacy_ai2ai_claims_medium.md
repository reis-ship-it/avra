## Claims

1. A method for offline quantum-inspired personality matching using peer-to-peer connections and privacy-preserving anonymized signatures, comprising:
(a) Exchanging personality profiles via Bluetooth/NSD without internet connectivity;
(b) Generating local quantum state vectors `|ψ_local⟩` and `|ψ_remote⟩` on-device;
(c) Creating anonymized vibe signatures that preserve quantum state properties;
(d) Calculating compatibility locally using quantum inner product `C = |⟨ψ_local|ψ_remote⟩|²`;
(e) Applying learning insights immediately without cloud infrastructure.

2. A system for offline quantum compatibility calculation with privacy preservation, comprising:
(a) Peer-to-peer personality profile exchange via Bluetooth/NSD;
(b) Local quantum state vector generation on-device;
(c) Anonymized vibe signature creation using differential privacy;
(d) Local quantum compatibility calculation via `C = |⟨ψ_A|ψ_B⟩|²`;
(e) Immediate offline AI learning application without internet connectivity.

3. The method of claim 1, further comprising privacy-preserving offline AI2AI quantum matching:
(a) Device discovery via Bluetooth/NSD without internet;
(b) Personality profile exchange peer-to-peer;
(c) Local anonymization of vibe signatures using differential privacy with post-normalization correction (correction_strength = 0.9, achieving 95.94% accuracy preservation);
(d) On-device quantum compatibility calculation using quantum inner product;
(e) Local learning exchange without internet connectivity.

4. An offline-first quantum matching system with privacy preservation, comprising:
(a) Peer-to-peer connection protocol via Bluetooth/NSD;
(b) Local quantum state vector generation on-device;
(c) Anonymized signature exchange that preserves quantum properties;
(d) Local compatibility calculation using quantum formulas;
(e) Immediate offline AI evolution without cloud dependency.
