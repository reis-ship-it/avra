## Claims

1. A method for quantum-inspired personality matching combined with automated partnership enforcement, comprising:
(a) Calculating quantum compatibility between business and expert personality states using `C = |⟨ψ_expert|ψ_business⟩|²`;
(b) Suggesting partnerships above 70% compatibility threshold using weighted formula `score = (vibe × 0.5) + (expertise × 0.3) + (location × 0.2)`;
(c) Automatically enforcing exclusivity constraints by intercepting event creation and checking against active exclusive partnerships;
(d) Tracking minimum event requirements using schedule compliance algorithm: `required_events = ceil(progress × minimum_event_count)`;
(e) Detecting breaches in real-time and applying automatic penalties.

2. An integrated system for business-expert partnership lifecycle management using quantum compatibility matching and automated enforcement, comprising:
(a) Quantum state vector personality representation for experts and businesses;
(b) Compatibility calculation via quantum inner product `C = |⟨ψ_expert|ψ_business⟩|²`;
(c) Partnership formation workflow with negotiation and digital signature integration;
(d) Real-time exclusivity constraint checking that intercepts event creation;
(e) Schedule compliance tracking with formulas: `progress = elapsed_days / total_days` and `required_events = ceil(progress × minimum_event_count)`;
(f) Breach detection with automatic penalty application.

3. The method of claim 1, further comprising quantum-based partnership discovery and enforcement:
(a) Generating quantum personality states `|ψ_expert⟩` and `|ψ_business⟩` for expert and business;
(b) Calculating compatibility via `C = |⟨ψ_expert|ψ_business⟩|²`;
(c) Filtering matches above 70% threshold using weighted formula;
(d) Creating partnerships with negotiation workflow and pre-event agreement locking;
(e) Automatically enforcing exclusivity by checking event creation against active partnerships;
(f) Tracking minimum requirements with schedule compliance algorithm;
(g) Detecting breaches and applying penalties automatically.

4. An automated partnership ecosystem using quantum matching and enforcement, comprising:
(a) Quantum compatibility engine calculating `C = |⟨ψ_expert|ψ_business⟩|²`;
(b) Partnership formation system with negotiation and digital signatures;
(c) Exclusivity enforcement algorithm that intercepts and validates event creation;
(d) Minimum event tracking with schedule compliance: `required_events = ceil(progress × minimum_event_count)`;
(e) Breach detection system with real-time monitoring and automatic penalty application;
(f) Feedback loop that improves quantum matching based on partnership success.

## Appendix

### Optional companion independent claims (for counsel)

- **System claim (optional):** A system comprising one or more processors and memory storing instructions that, when executed, cause the system to perform the method of claim 1.
- **Non-transitory computer-readable medium claim (optional):** A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform the method of claim 1.
