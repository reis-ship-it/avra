## Claims

1. A method for integrating physiological data into personality matching using quantum states, comprising:
(a) Receiving real-time biometric data from wearable devices;
(b) Creating physiological quantum state vector `|ψ_physiological⟩` from biometric data;
(c) Extending personality quantum state vector using tensor product: `|ψ_complete⟩ = |ψ_personality⟩ ⊗ |ψ_physiological⟩`;
(d) Calculating enhanced compatibility: `C_complete = |⟨ψ_A_personality|ψ_B_personality⟩|² × |⟨ψ_A_physiological|ψ_B_physiological⟩|²`;
(e) Matching users based on combined personality and physiological compatibility.

2. A system for contextual personality matching based on real-time biometric data, comprising:
(a) Real-time biometric data collection from wearable devices (heart rate, HRV, activity, stress, eye tracking);
(b) Physiological quantum state vector generation from biometric data;
(c) Extended quantum state vector creation using tensor product of personality and physiological states;
(d) Enhanced compatibility calculation combining personality and physiological compatibility;
(e) Contextual matching that adjusts recommendations based on current physiological state.

3. The method of claim 1, further comprising extending quantum personality states with physiological data:
(a) Representing personality as quantum state vector `|ψ_personality⟩` in 12-dimensional space;
(b) Representing physiological state as quantum state vector `|ψ_physiological⟩` in 5-dimensional space;
(c) Creating extended quantum state using tensor product: `|ψ_complete⟩ = |ψ_personality⟩ ⊗ |ψ_physiological⟩`;
(d) Calculating compatibility using extended quantum states;
(e) Entangling personality and physiological states to discover correlations.

## Appendix

### Optional companion independent claims (for counsel)

- **System claim (optional):** A system comprising one or more processors and memory storing instructions that, when executed, cause the system to perform the method of claim 1.
- **Non-transitory computer-readable medium claim (optional):** A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform the method of claim 1.
