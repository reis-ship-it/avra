## Claims

1. A method for calculating personality compatibility using quantum state vectors, comprising:
(a) Representing personality dimensions as quantum states `|ψ⟩`;
(b) Calculating quantum inner product `⟨ψ_A|ψ_B⟩` between two personality states;
(c) Computing compatibility score as `C = |⟨ψ_A|ψ_B⟩|²`;
(d) Returning compatibility score for personality matching.

2. A system for representing multi-dimensional personality profiles as quantum states, comprising:
(a) Quantum state vector representation of personality dimensions;
(b) State vector normalization to maintain quantum properties;
(c) Superposition support for multi-state personality representation;
(d) Quantum measurement operators for compatibility calculation.

3. The method of claim 1, further comprising applying quantum entanglement to compatibility calculations:
(a) Entangling energy and exploration dimensions: `|ψ_entangled⟩ = |ψ_energy⟩ ⊗ |ψ_exploration⟩`;
(b) Calculating compatibility using entangled states;
(c) Measuring non-local correlations through entanglement;
(d) Collapsing entangled states during compatibility measurement.

4. A quantum-inspired regularization technique for noisy personality data, comprising:
(a) Applying quantum measurement principles to handle incomplete data;
(b) Accounting for quantum uncertainty in personality measurements;
(c) Managing decoherence in noisy environments;
(d) Purifying quantum states from noisy measurements.

### Optional companion independent claims (for counsel)

- **System claim (optional):** A system comprising one or more processors and memory storing instructions that, when executed, cause the system to perform the method of claim 1.
- **Non-transitory computer-readable medium claim (optional):** A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform the method of claim 1.
