## Claims

1. A method for hybrid quantum-classical recommendation scoring, comprising:
(a) Calculating baseline calling score using quantum-inspired mathematics (70% weight) via `C = |⟨ψ_user|ψ_opportunity⟩|²` and weighted formula;
(b) Applying classical neural network refinements (30% weight) for pattern learning and outcome prediction;
(c) Gradually increasing neural network weight as confidence grows based on performance monitoring;
(d) Maintaining offline-first architecture with on-device computation for both quantum calculations and neural network inference.

2. A system for adaptive hybrid recommendation scoring using quantum math and neural networks, comprising:
(a) Quantum-inspired baseline calculation via `C = |⟨ψ_user|ψ_opportunity⟩|²` with calling score formula;
(b) Classical neural network pattern learning for individual trajectory prediction and outcome prediction;
(c) Confidence-based weight adjustment that increases neural network weight as confidence grows;
(d) Automatic fallback to formula-based system if neural network fails or performance degrades;
(e) Performance monitoring that tracks neural network accuracy vs. formula baseline.

3. The method of claim 1, further comprising privacy-preserving hybrid recommendation system:
(a) On-device quantum-inspired baseline calculation using quantum state vectors;
(b) On-device neural network inference using ONNX runtime without cloud dependency;
(c) Anonymized pattern sharing for federated learning (no raw data);
(d) Adaptive weight adjustment based on performance monitoring;
(e) User control for opting out of neural network training.

4. An integrated recommendation system combining quantum math and neural networks, comprising:
(a) Quantum compatibility calculation `C = |⟨ψ_user|ψ_opportunity⟩|²`;
(b) Calling score formula with weighted factors (vibe, life betterment, connection, context, timing);
(c) Classical neural network refinements for pattern learning and outcome prediction;
(d) Outcome-based learning integration with enhanced learning rate (β = 2α);
(e) Gradual transition from formula-based (70%) to neural network-enhanced recommendations with adaptive weighting.
