## Claims

1. A method for representing AI emotional state as quantum state vector enabling self-assessment, comprising:
(a) Representing AI emotional state as quantum state vector `|ψ_emotion⟩ = [satisfaction, confidence, fulfillment, growth, alignment]ᵀ`;
(b) Normalizing quantum state vector to unit length;
(c) Calculating quality score via quantum inner product: `quality_score = |⟨ψ_emotion|ψ_target⟩|²`;
(d) Using quality score for self-assessment independent of user input;
(e) Determining work quality based on quantum coherence with target state.

2. A system for AI self-assessment using quantum emotional scale, comprising:
(a) Quantum emotional state representation module creating `|ψ_emotion⟩` state vectors;
(b) Self-assessment calculation module computing `quality_score = |⟨ψ_emotion|ψ_target⟩|²`;
(c) Target state definition module defining ideal emotional states;
(d) Autonomous assessment module evaluating work quality without user input;
(e) Integration module connecting with self-improving network;
(f) AI2AI learning integration module using emotional states in learning exchanges;
(g) Emotional compatibility calculation module computing `|⟨ψ₁|ψ₂⟩|²` for AI pairs.

3. The method of claim 1, further comprising quantum emotional intelligence in distributed AI networks:
(a) Representing each AI's emotional state as quantum state vector;
(b) Calculating self-assessment via quantum coherence: `quality_score = |⟨ψ_emotion|ψ_target⟩|²`;
(c) Sharing emotional insights across network (privacy-preserving);
(d) Calculating emotional compatibility between AIs: `|⟨ψ₁|ψ₂⟩|²`;
(e) Using emotional compatibility to optimize AI2AI learning exchanges;
(f) Using emotional states to guide network-wide improvement;
(g) Creating collective emotional intelligence from individual emotional states.

## Appendix

### Optional companion independent claims (for counsel)

- **System claim (optional):** A system comprising one or more processors and memory storing instructions that, when executed, cause the system to perform the method of claim 1.
- **Non-transitory computer-readable medium claim (optional):** A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform the method of claim 1.
