## Claims

1. A method for multi-path expertise recognition with weighted algorithm, comprising:
(a) Calculating expertise across six paths: Exploration (40%), Credentials (25%), Influence (20%), Professional (25%), Community (15%), Local (varies);
(b) Combining path scores using weighted formula: `score = (exploration × 0.40) + (credentials × 0.25) + (influence × 0.20) + (professional × 0.25) + (community × 0.15) + (local × weight)`;
(c) Dynamically scaling thresholds based on platform phase, category saturation, and geographic hierarchy;
(d) Enforcing geographic hierarchy (Local → City → Regional → National → Global) for expertise scope.

2. A system for dynamic expertise threshold scaling with economic enablement, comprising:
(a) Multi-path expertise calculation with six weighted paths;
(b) Platform phase scaling (bootstrap, growth, scale, mature) adjusting thresholds;
(c) Category saturation algorithm using 6-factor analysis (supply, quality, utilization, demand, growth, geographic distribution);
(d) Locality-specific threshold adjustments based on locality values;
(e) Geographic hierarchy enforcement restricting event hosting to expertise scope.

3. The method of claim 1, further comprising economic enablement through expertise recognition:
(a) Multi-path expertise calculation enabling diverse forms of expertise recognition;
(b) Dynamic threshold scaling adapting to platform growth and category saturation;
(c) Automatic check-in system tracking visits passively (geofencing + Bluetooth/AI2AI);
(d) Partnership formation requiring expertise threshold with quantum matching;
(e) Expertise boost feedback loop where partnerships boost expertise enabling more partnerships.

4. An integrated expertise and economic system, comprising:
(a) Multi-path weighted expertise algorithm (6 paths with specific weights);
(b) Dynamic threshold scaling with platform phase and category saturation adjustments;
(c) Automatic passive check-in system with geofencing and Bluetooth/AI2AI verification;
(d) Geographic hierarchy enforcement (Local → City → Regional → National → Global);
(e) Partnership formation and revenue distribution enabling economic opportunities;
(f) Expertise boost feedback loop creating sustainable income streams.
