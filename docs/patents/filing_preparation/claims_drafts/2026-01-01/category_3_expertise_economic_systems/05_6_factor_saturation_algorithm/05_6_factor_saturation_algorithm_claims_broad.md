## Claims

1. A method for dynamic expertise threshold adjustment using 6-factor saturation analysis, comprising:
(a) Calculating a supply ratio factor by dividing the number of experts by the total number of users and normalizing against a target ratio of 2%;
(b) Analyzing a quality distribution factor by computing a weighted average of expert ratings, engagement rates, and verification status;
(c) Computing a utilization rate factor by measuring the ratio of active experts to total experts and events hosted to potential capacity;
(d) Measuring a demand signal factor by analyzing search trends, wait list ratios, follow requests, and list subscriptions;
(e) Evaluating a growth velocity factor by calculating growth rate instability from expert count changes over time periods.

2. A system for preventing expertise oversaturation using multi-factor analysis, comprising:
(a) A 6-factor saturation algorithm with weighted combination of factors;
(b) A supply ratio calculation module that normalizes expert-to-user ratio against a 2% target;
(c) A quality distribution analysis module that evaluates expert quality using ratings, engagement, and verification;
(d) A utilization rate computation module that measures active expert usage and event capacity;
(e) A demand signal measurement module that analyzes user search trends and engagement patterns;
(f) A growth velocity evaluation module that calculates growth rate stability and instability;
(g) A geographic distribution analysis module that computes location clustering coefficients;
(h) A dynamic threshold adjustment module that applies saturation multiplier to base requirements.

3. The method of claim 1, further comprising sophisticated expertise saturation analysis using 6 weighted factors:
(a) Calculating supply ratio (25% weight) by normalizing expert-to-user ratio against 2% target;
(b) Analyzing quality distribution (20% weight) using inverted quality score (1 - quality);
(c) Computing utilization rate (20% weight) using inverted utilization score (1 - utilization);
(d) Measuring demand signal (15% weight) using inverted demand score (1 - demand);
(e) Evaluating growth velocity (10% weight) as growth instability from rate changes;
(f) Analyzing geographic distribution (10% weight) as clustering coefficient from location entropy;
(g) Calculating saturation score from weighted combination of all six factors;
(h) Generating dynamic threshold adjustment recommendation based on saturation score.

4. An expertise management system using 6-factor saturation algorithm, comprising:
(a) Multi-factor saturation analysis with six distinct factors;
(b) Quality-based threshold adjustment that increases requirements when quality is low;
(c) Utilization-based requirements that scale based on active expert usage;
(d) Demand-responsive scaling that adjusts thresholds based on user demand signals;
(e) Growth velocity monitoring that detects unhealthy growth patterns;
(f) Geographic distribution optimization that prevents location clustering;
(g) Dynamic expertise requirement calculation using saturation multiplier (1.0x - 3.0x range).
