## Claims

1. A method for calculating unified calling scores combining quantum compatibility with life betterment factors, meaningful connection probability, context awareness, and timing optimization, comprising:
(a) Calculating quantum compatibility via `C = |⟨ψ_user|ψ_opportunity⟩|²`;
(b) Computing life betterment factor from individual trajectory potential, positive influence, and fulfillment;
(c) Determining meaningful connection probability from compatibility and network effects;
(d) Applying context factor (location, time, journey, receptivity) and timing factor (optimal timing, user patterns);
(e) Combining factors with weighted formula: `score = (vibe × 0.40) + (life_betterment × 0.30) + (connection × 0.15) + (context × 0.10) + (timing × 0.05)`;
(f) Applying 70% threshold to "call" users to action, wherein comprising:; and wherein further comprising context-aware recommendation scoring with outcome-based learning:; and wherein comprising:.

2. A system for outcome-based personality learning from real-world actions, comprising:
(a) Calculating calling scores with multi-factor formula (vibe: 40%, life betterment: 30%, connection: 15%, context: 10%, timing: 5%);
(b) Tracking user actions and outcomes (positive, negative, neutral);
(c) Applying outcome-enhanced convergence formula: `|ψ_new⟩ = |ψ_current⟩ + α·M·I₁₂·(|ψ_target⟩ - |ψ_current⟩) + β·O·|Δ_outcome⟩` where `β = 2α` and `O` is outcome mask;
(d) Updating personality states based on real-world results with enhanced learning rate.

3. The method of claim 1, further comprising context-aware recommendation scoring with outcome-based learning:
(a) Calculating base quantum compatibility `C = |⟨ψ_user|ψ_opportunity⟩|²`;
(b) Applying context factor (location, time, journey, receptivity) and timing factor (optimal timing, user patterns);
(c) Computing life betterment factor from individual trajectory potential;
(d) Determining meaningful connection probability from compatibility and network effects;
(e) Combining factors with weighted formula and applying 70% threshold;
(f) Tracking real-world outcomes and updating personality states using outcome-enhanced convergence.

4. An adaptive recommendation system using calling scores and outcome learning, comprising:
(a) Unified calling score calculation with quantum compatibility (40%), life betterment factors (30%), meaningful connection probability (15%), context factor (10%), and timing factor (5%);
(b) 70% threshold for "calling" users to action;
(c) Real-world outcome tracking (positive, negative, neutral);
(d) Outcome-based personality state updates with enhanced learning rate (`β = 2α`) using outcome-enhanced convergence formula.
