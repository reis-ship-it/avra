## Claims

1. A method for matching multiple entities using quantum entanglement, comprising:
(a) Representing each entity as quantum state vector `|ψ_entity⟩` **including quantum vibe analysis**;
(b) Quantum vibe analysis uses quantum superposition, interference, and entanglement;
(c) Compiles personality, behavioral, social, relationship, and temporal insights;
(d) Produces 12 quantum vibe dimensions per entity;
(e) **Each user has unique quantum vibe signature** for personalized matching.

2. A system for optimizing entanglement coefficients in multi-entity matching, comprising:
(a) Calculating pairwise compatibility between entities;
(b) Determining entity type weights (expert, business, brand, event, etc.);
(c) Applying role-based weights (primary, secondary, sponsor, etc.);
(d) Optimizing coefficients: `α_optimal = argmax_α |⟨ψ_entangled(α)|ψ_ideal⟩|²`;
(e) Adapting coefficients based on match outcomes;
(f) Using quantum interference to refine coefficients.

3. A system for AI2AI-enhanced multi-entity matching, comprising:
(a) Personality learning from successful multi-entity matches;
(b) Offline-first multi-entity matching capability;
(c) Privacy-preserving quantum signatures for matching;
(d) Real-time personality evolution updates;
(e) Network-wide learning from multi-entity patterns;
(f) Cross-entity personality compatibility learning.

## Appendix

### Optional companion independent claims (for counsel)

- **System claim (optional):** A system comprising one or more processors and memory storing instructions that, when executed, cause the system to perform the method of claim 1.
- **Non-transitory computer-readable medium claim (optional):** A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform the method of claim 1.
