## Claims

1. A method for matching multiple entities using quantum entanglement, comprising:
(a) Representing each entity as quantum state vector `|ψ_entity⟩` **including quantum vibe analysis**;
(b) Quantum vibe analysis uses quantum superposition, interference, and entanglement;
(c) Compiles personality, behavioral, social, relationship, and temporal insights;
(d) Produces 12 quantum vibe dimensions per entity;
(e) **Each user has unique quantum vibe signature** for personalized matching;
(f) **Event creation constraint:** Events are created by active entities (Experts or Businesses) and become separate entities once created;
(g) **Entity type distinction:** Businesses and brands are separate entity types, but a business can also be a brand (dual entity, tracked separately);
(h) **Entity deduplication:** If a business is already in a partnership, it does NOT need to be "called" separately as a brand (and vice versa);
(i) **Dynamic user calling based on entangled state:** Users are called to events based on the **entangled quantum state** of all entities (brands, businesses, experts, location, timing, etc.) using `user_entangled_compatibility = |⟨ψ_user|ψ_entangled⟩|²`;
(j) **Immediate calling:** Users are called as soon as event is created (based on initial entanglement);
(k) **Real-time re-evaluation:** Each entity addition (business, brand, expert) triggers re-evaluation of user compatibility;
(l) **Dynamic updates:** New users called as entities are added (if compatibility improves);
(m) **Stop calling:** Users may stop being called if compatibility drops below 70% threshold;
(n) **Entanglement-based:** Users matched to entangled state of ALL entities, not just event alone;
(o) **Multi-factor matching:** Users matched based on entanglement of brands, businesses, experts, location, timing, etc;
(p) Multiple users can be matched to same event;
(q) Users can be matched to multiple events simultaneously;
(r) Enables personalized event discovery based on evolving entangled state;
(s) Creating entangled quantum state: `|ψ_entangled⟩ = Σᵢ αᵢ |ψ_entity_i⟩ ⊗ |ψ_entity_j⟩ ⊗ ...` (where each entity includes quantum vibe analysis, including users);
(t) Calculating compatibility: `compatibility = f(|⟨ψ_entangled|ψ_ideal⟩|², quantum_vibe_compatibility)`;
(u) Base compatibility from entity entanglement;
(v) Quantum vibe compatibility from vibe dimension entanglement;
(w) Combined with weighted formula (e.g., 60% base + 40% vibe);
(x) User-event compatibility calculated separately: `|⟨ψ_user|ψ_event⟩|²`;
(y) Optimizing entanglement coefficients `αᵢ` for maximum compatibility (enhanced by quantum vibe analysis);
(z) Using quantum interference effects to enhance matching accuracy (includes vibe interference).

2. A system for optimizing entanglement coefficients in multi-entity matching, comprising:
(a) Calculating pairwise compatibility between entities;
(b) Determining entity type weights (expert, business, brand, event, etc.);
(c) Applying role-based weights (primary, secondary, sponsor, etc.);
(d) Optimizing coefficients: `α_optimal = argmax_α |⟨ψ_entangled(α)|ψ_ideal⟩|²`;
(e) Adapting coefficients based on match outcomes;
(f) Using quantum interference to refine coefficients.

3. A system for AI2AI-enhanced multi-entity matching, comprising:
(a) Personality learning from successful multi-entity matches;
(b) Offline-first multi-entity matching capability;
(c) Privacy-preserving quantum signatures for matching;
(d) Real-time personality evolution updates;
(e) Network-wide learning from multi-entity patterns;
(f) Cross-entity personality compatibility learning.
