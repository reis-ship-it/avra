## Snapshot
- **Abstract word count**: 104
- **Independent claim type (heuristic)**: method
- **Distinctive hooks present (auto-detected)**:
  - atomic-time / atomic timestamp integration
  - quantum-state representation + compatibility computation
  - zero-knowledge / anonymized signature exchange

## Claim dependency map (auto-parsed)
- Claim 1 → no explicit claim reference detected in lead-in
- Claim 2 → no explicit claim reference detected in lead-in
- Claim 3 → depends on claim(s): 1
- Claim 4 → no explicit claim reference detected in lead-in

## Potential antecedent basis flags (heuristic)
- None flagged by heuristic.

## Potential indefiniteness / clarity flags (counts)
- **and/or**: 0
- **approximately/about**: 0
- **may/can**: 0
- **etc.**: 0
- **e.g.**: 0

## Written description support scan (heuristic)
Terms present in claims that were **not found** in `## Detailed Description` (heuristic):
- `elapsed_days`
- `inner product`
- `minimum_event_count`
- `quantum state`
- `required_events`
- `total_days`

## Definitions coverage
Defined terms detected in `## Definitions`:
- `Atomic timestamp`
- `Compatibility score`
- `Entity`
- `Profile`

## Counsel notes (fill-in)
- **Center-of-gravity**: (what we want claim 1 to own)
- **Narrowing fallback**: (if prior art requires narrowing)
- **Enablement risk**: (any step that is underspecified)
- **Prior art search terms**: (keywords counsel should search)
