# Master Plan - Optimized Execution Sequence

**Created:** November 21, 2025  
**Status:** 🎯 Active Execution Plan  
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for implementation order  
**Last Updated:** November 21, 2025

---

## 🚪 **Philosophy: Doors, Not Badges**

**This Master Plan follows SPOTS philosophy: "Doors, not badges"**

### **MANDATORY: All Work Must Follow Doors Philosophy**

**Every feature, every phase, every implementation MUST answer these questions:**

1. **What doors does this help users open?**
   - Does this open doors to experiences, communities, people, meaning?
   - Is this a door-opening mechanism, not just a feature?

2. **When are users ready for these doors?**
   - Does this show doors at the right time?
   - Is this overwhelming or appropriately timed?

3. **Is this being a good key?**
   - Does this help users find their doors?
   - Does this respect user autonomy (they choose which doors to open)?

4. **Is the AI learning with the user?**
   - Does this enable the AI to learn which doors resonate?
   - Does this support "always learning with you"?

**These questions are MANDATORY for every phase. No exceptions.**

### **What This Means for Execution:**

- **Authentic Contributions:** We build features that open doors for users, not gamification systems
- **Real Value:** Every phase delivers genuine value, not checkboxes
- **User Journey:** Features connect users to experiences, communities, and meaning
- **Quality Over Speed:** Better to do it right than fast (but we optimize for both)

### **How This Shapes the Plan:**

- **No artificial milestones** - Phases complete when work is genuinely done
- **No badge-chasing** - Progress measured by doors opened, not tasks checked
- **Authentic integration** - Features connect naturally, not forced
- **User-first sequencing** - Critical user doors open first (App functionality before compliance)

### **Core Doors Documents (MANDATORY REFERENCES):**

- **`docs/plans/philosophy_implementation/DOORS.md`** - The conversation that revealed the truth
- **`OUR_GUTS.md`** - Core values (leads with doors philosophy)
- **`docs/plans/philosophy_implementation/SPOTS_PHILOSOPHY_AND_ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Complete philosophy guide

**All work must align with these documents. They are not optional references - they are the foundation.**

---

## 🎯 **What This Is**

**This is THE execution plan.** All other plans are reference guides. This Master Plan:
- ✅ Optimizes execution by batching common phases
- ✅ Enables parallel work through catch-up prioritization
- ✅ Considers dependencies, priorities, and timelines
- ✅ Follows SPOTS philosophy and methodology (not just references them)
- ✅ Updates automatically as work progresses

**For detailed progress:** See individual plan folders (`docs/plans/[plan_name]/`)

---

## 🚨 **MANDATORY: All Work Must Follow Philosophy, Methodology, and Doors**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Every feature, every phase, every implementation from this Master Plan MUST:**

### **1. Follow Doors Philosophy (MANDATORY)**

**Before starting ANY work, read:**
- `docs/plans/philosophy_implementation/DOORS.md` - The conversation that revealed the truth
- `OUR_GUTS.md` - Core values (leads with doors philosophy)
- `docs/plans/philosophy_implementation/SPOTS_PHILOSOPHY_AND_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete guide

**Every feature MUST answer:**
1. **What doors does this help users open?** (experiences, communities, people, meaning)
2. **When are users ready for these doors?** (appropriate timing, not overwhelming)
3. **Is this being a good key?** (helps users find their doors, respects autonomy)
4. **Is the AI learning with the user?** (learns which doors resonate)

**These questions are MANDATORY. No work proceeds without answering them.**

### **2. Follow Development Methodology (MANDATORY)**

**Before starting ANY work, read:**
- `docs/plans/methodology/DEVELOPMENT_METHODOLOGY.md` - Complete methodology guide
- `docs/plans/methodology/START_HERE_NEW_TASK.md` - 40-minute context protocol
- `docs/plans/methodology/SESSION_START_CHECKLIST.md` - Session start checklist

**Every feature MUST:**
1. **Context gathering first** - 40-minute investment before implementation
   - Cross-reference all plans
   - Search existing implementations
   - Read philosophy and doors documents
   - Understand dependencies
2. **Follow quality standards** - Zero errors, tests, documentation, full integration
3. **Follow systematic execution** - Sequential phases, batched authentically
4. **Follow architecture alignment** - ai2ai only, offline-first, self-improving

**These are MANDATORY requirements. No work proceeds without following them.**

### **3. Follow Architecture Principles (MANDATORY)**

**Every feature MUST:**
- **ai2ai only** (never p2p) - All device interactions through personality learning AI
- **Self-improving** - Features enable AIs to learn and improve
- **Offline-first** - Features work offline, cloud enhances
- **Personality learning** - Features integrate with personality system

**These are MANDATORY. No exceptions.**

### **4. Verification Before Completion (MANDATORY)**

**Before marking any phase/feature complete, verify:**
- ✅ Doors questions answered (What doors? When ready? Good key? Learning?)
- ✅ Methodology followed (Context gathered? Quality standards met?)
- ✅ Architecture aligned (ai2ai? Offline? Self-improving?)
- ✅ Philosophy documents read (DOORS.md, OUR_GUTS.md, SPOTS_PHILOSOPHY_AND_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- ✅ Methodology documents read (DEVELOPMENT_METHODOLOGY.md, START_HERE_NEW_TASK.md)

**No work is complete without these verifications.**

## 📋 **Methodology: Systematic Approach**

**This Master Plan follows Development Methodology principles:**

### **MANDATORY: All Work Must Follow Methodology**

**Every feature, every phase, every implementation MUST follow:**

1. **Context Gathering First (40 minutes):**
   - Cross-reference all plans before starting work
   - Search existing implementations to avoid duplication
   - Understand dependencies before sequencing
   - Read SPOTS Philosophy and Doors documents
   - **This is MANDATORY. No skipping to implementation.**

2. **Quality Standards (Non-Negotiable):**
   - Zero linter errors before completion
   - Full integration (users can access features)
   - Tests written for all new code
   - Documentation complete for all features
   - **These are not optional. They are requirements.**

3. **Systematic Execution:**
   - Phases are sequential within a feature (Models → Service → UI → Tests)
   - Common phases batched across features (all Models together when possible)
   - Dependencies respected (foundation before advanced)
   - Progress tracked authentically (real completion, not checkboxes)

4. **Architecture Alignment:**
   - **ai2ai only** (never p2p) - All device interactions through personality learning AI
   - **Self-improving** - AIs improve as individuals, network, and ecosystem
   - **Offline-first** - Features work offline, cloud is enhancement
   - **Doors philosophy** - Every feature opens doors, not badges

### **Methodology Documents (MANDATORY REFERENCES):**

- **`docs/plans/methodology/DEVELOPMENT_METHODOLOGY.md`** - Complete methodology guide
- **`docs/plans/methodology/START_HERE_NEW_TASK.md`** - 40-minute context protocol
- **`docs/plans/methodology/SESSION_START_CHECKLIST.md`** - Session start checklist

**All work must follow these methodologies. They are not optional - they are how we work.**

## 🔄 **Catch-Up Prioritization Logic**

**Philosophy Alignment:** This enables authentic parallel work - features that naturally align can work together, opening more doors simultaneously.

**When a new feature arrives:**
1. **Pause** active features at current phase (authentic pause, not artificial)
2. **Prioritize** new feature to catch up (if it opens doors users need)
3. **Resume** in parallel once caught up (natural alignment)
4. **Finish** together (authentic completion, not forced)

**Example:**
- Feature A at Service phase (100%) - Opening doors for users
- Feature B arrives (needs Models → Service → UI) - Opens related doors
- Feature B catches up (Models, Service) - Authentic catch-up
- Both work UI together in parallel - Natural alignment
- Both finish together - Users get complete door-opening experience

**Methodology Alignment:** This follows systematic batching - common phases naturally align, enabling authentic parallel work without forcing artificial milestones.

---

## 🎯 **Priority Principle: App Functionality First**

**CRITICAL RULE:** App functionality is ALWAYS the top priority in determining Master Plan order.

**This principle is MANDATORY and overrides all other prioritization logic.**

### **What This Means:**
- ✅ **Functional features** (users can DO something) come before compliance/operations
- ✅ **Core user flows** (discover, create, pay, attend) come before polish
- ✅ **MVP blockers** (payment, discovery UI) come before nice-to-haves
- ❌ **Compliance features** (refunds, tax, fraud) come AFTER users can use the app

### **Priority Order:**
1. **P0 - MVP Blockers:** Features that prevent users from using the app
   - Payment processing (can't pay for events)
   - Event discovery UI (can't find events)
2. **P1 - Core Functionality:** Features that enable core user flows
   - Easy event hosting UI (can create events easily)
   - Basic expertise UI (can see progress)
3. **P2 - Enhancements:** Features that improve experience
   - Partnerships (adds value, not required)
   - Advanced expertise (adds value, not required)
4. **P3 - Compliance:** Features needed for scale/legal
   - Refund policies (can start simple)
   - Tax compliance (needed after revenue)
   - Fraud prevention (needed at scale)

### **Decision Framework:**
**When prioritizing features, ask:**
1. "Can users use the app without this?" → If NO, it's P0
2. "Does this enable a core user flow?" → If YES, it's P1
3. "Does this improve an existing flow?" → If YES, it's P2
4. "Is this needed for legal/compliance?" → If YES, it's P3 (post-MVP)

**This principle ensures users can actually use the app before we add compliance layers.**

- Architecture decisions pending
- Not blocking other work

**Timeline:** 12-16 weeks (when resumed)

---

## 🎯 **Execution Principles**

**These principles EMBODY the philosophy and methodology, not just reference them:**

### **1. Batch Common Phases (Methodology: Systematic Batching)**
- All DB models together (when possible) - Authentic efficiency
- All service layers together (when possible) - Natural alignment
- All UI together (when possible) - User experience coherence
- All tests together (when possible) - Quality assurance batching

**Why:** Follows methodology's systematic approach - batch similar work for authentic efficiency, not artificial speed.

### **2. Catch-Up Prioritization (Philosophy: Natural Alignment)**
- New features pause active features - Authentic pause, not forced
- New features catch up to active phase - Natural alignment opportunity
- Then work in parallel - Authentic parallel work
- Finish together - Complete door-opening experience

**Why:** Enables features that naturally align to work together, opening more doors simultaneously for users.

### **3. Dependency Ordering (Methodology: Foundation First)**
- P0 MVP blockers first (Payment, Discovery, Hosting) - Opens essential doors
- Foundation before advanced (Event Partnership before Brand Sponsorship) - Natural progression
- Dependencies resolved before dependent features - Authentic sequencing

**Why:** Follows methodology's foundation-first approach - build doors that other doors can open from.

### **4. Priority-Based (Philosophy: User Doors First)**
- CRITICAL (P0) → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW
- Within same priority: dependencies first

**Why:** Opens the most important doors first - App functionality enables users to actually use the platform. Compliance comes after users can use it.

### **5. Philosophy & Architecture Alignment (MANDATORY, Not Optional)**

**🚨 CRITICAL: All work from this Master Plan MUST follow these principles. This is not optional.**

**Philosophy Principles (MANDATORY):**
- **"Doors, not badges"** - Every phase opens real doors, not checkboxes
  - **Required Question:** "What doors does this help users open?"
- **Authentic contributions** - Work delivers genuine value, not gamification
  - **Required Question:** "Is this being a good key?"
- **User journey** - Features connect users to experiences, communities, meaning
  - **Required Question:** "Does this support Spots → Community → Life?"
- **Quality over speed** - Better to open doors right than fast
  - **Required Question:** "Are we opening doors authentically?"

**Architecture Principles (MANDATORY):**
- **ai2ai only** - All features designed for ai2ai network, never p2p
  - **Required Check:** Does this use ai2ai? (Never p2p)
- **Self-improving** - Features enable AIs to learn and improve
  - **Required Check:** Does this enable "always learning with you"?
- **Offline-first** - Features work offline, cloud enhances
  - **Required Check:** Does this work offline?
- **Personality learning** - Features integrate with personality system
  - **Required Check:** Does this learn which doors resonate?

**Methodology Principles (MANDATORY):**
- **Context gathering first** - 40-minute investment before implementation
  - **Required:** Read DOORS.md, OUR_GUTS.md, SPOTS_PHILOSOPHY_AND_ARCHITECTURE.md
  - **Required:** Follow DEVELOPMENT_METHODOLOGY.md protocol
- **Systematic execution** - Phases are sequential, batched authentically
  - **Required:** Follow methodology's systematic approach
- **Quality standards** - Zero errors, full integration, tests, documentation
  - **Required:** All quality standards met before completion
- **Cross-referencing** - Always check existing work before starting
  - **Required:** Search existing implementations, avoid duplication

**These aren't just references - they're MANDATORY requirements for all work.**

## 🔄 **How to Use This Master Plan**

**Following Methodology: Systematic Approach with Context Gathering**

### **For Implementation (Following Methodology Protocol):**

**Before Starting (40-minute context gathering):**
1. **Read this Master Plan** - Understand current execution sequence
2. **Read detailed plan** in plan folder (`docs/plans/[plan_name]/`)
3. **Cross-reference** related plans and existing implementations
4. **Search existing code** - Avoid duplication, leverage patterns
5. **Understand dependencies** - Know what this phase depends on
6. **Check SPOTS Philosophy** - Ensure work aligns with "doors, not badges"
7. **Create TODO list** - Systematic breakdown of tasks

**During Implementation:**
1. **Work on current phase** tasks systematically
2. **Follow quality standards** - Zero errors, tests, documentation
3. **Answer doors questions** - What doors does this open? Is this being a good key?
4. **Follow methodology** - Systematic approach, quality standards, architecture alignment
5. **Update progress authentically** - Real completion, not checkboxes
6. **Update plan folder** (`progress.md`, `status.md`, `working_status.md`)

**After Completion:**
1. **Verify doors alignment** - Does this open doors? Is this being a good key?
2. **Verify methodology compliance** - All quality standards met? Context gathered?
3. **Update Master Plan** when phase completes authentically
4. **Document learnings** - What doors did this open? How did it follow methodology?
5. **Update cross-references** - How does this connect to other features?

### **For Adding New Features (Following Methodology + Philosophy):**

**Step 1: Context Gathering (40 minutes):**
1. **Create comprehensive plan** document (following methodology)
2. **Check Master Plan Tracker** - Does this belong in existing plan?
3. **Cross-reference** related plans and features
4. **Search existing implementations** - Avoid duplication
5. **Understand dependencies** - What doors does this need?

**Step 2: Philosophy Alignment:**
1. **Verify "doors, not badges"** - Does this open real doors?
2. **Check architecture alignment** - ai2ai only, offline-first, self-improving
3. **Ensure authentic value** - Not gamification, real user benefit

**Step 3: Master Plan Integration:**
1. **Create plan folder** with supporting docs
2. **Add to Master Plan Tracker**
3. **Analyze for Master Plan integration** (dependencies, priority, catch-up opportunities)
4. **Insert into Master Plan** at optimal position (following principles)
5. **Update execution sequence** authentically

### **For Status Queries (Following Methodology: Comprehensive Search):**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Read ALL Related Documents (Not Just One)**

1. **Check Master Plan** for high-level overview
2. **Check individual plan folders** for detailed progress
3. **Find ALL related documents:**
   - `progress.md` - Detailed progress
   - `status.md` - Current status
   - `blockers.md` - Blockers/dependencies
   - `working_status.md` - Active work
   - `*_COMPLETE.md` - Completion reports
   - `*_SUMMARY.md` - Summary documents
4. **Synthesize comprehensive answer** from ALL sources

**Following Methodology:** Never read just one document for status queries - always comprehensive search.
