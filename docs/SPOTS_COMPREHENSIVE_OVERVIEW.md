5. **Expertise Recognition** - Users become experts through genuine contributions

### **Business Model**

- **10% platform fee** on all paid events and transactions
- **Event ticketing** (hosts, partnerships, sponsorships)
- **Business partnerships** (venues, brands, organizations)
- **Future: AI learning data** (anonymized, aggregate insights)

### **Technical Foundation**

- **Flutter/Dart** - Cross-platform mobile app (iOS/Android)
- **185,162+ lines of code** across 549 files

## 🔑 **What Is SPOTS?**

### **The Simple Answer**

SPOTS is a mobile app that helps you:
1. **Discover** meaningful places (coffee shops, restaurants, bookstores)
2. **Build** lists of your favorite spots
3. **Find** communities and events at those places
4. **Connect** with people who share your interests
5. **Host** events once you become a local expert

### **The Philosophical Answer**

> **"There is no secret to life. Just doors that haven't been opened yet."**

SPOTS is **the key** that helps you open those doors. Every spot is a door:
- To experiences
- To communities
- To people
- To meaning
- To more doors

You decide which doors to open. You walk through them. You create your own journey. You find your own life.

**SPOTS just provides access.**

### **The Journey: Spots → Community → Life**

```
Find YOUR Spots
      ↓
Those spots have communities
      ↓
Those communities have events  
      ↓
You find YOUR people
      ↓
You find YOUR life
```

**Example:**
- **Week 1:** User asks for a coffee shop → SPOTS suggests one → User loves it
- **Week 3:** SPOTS learns user returns Tuesday mornings → Recognizes pattern
- **Week 5:** SPOTS suggests writers' group at that coffee shop → User attends
- **Week 10:** User has found their third place, community, and people

**SPOTS was the key. The user opened the doors. The user found their life.**

---

## 🚪 **Philosophy & Mission**

### **Core Philosophy: "Doors, Not Badges"**

SPOTS recognizes that authentic contributions matter more than gamification:

- ✅ **Doors** - Features that open access to experiences and communities
- ❌ **Badges** - Empty achievements that don't provide real value

**What This Means:**
- Expertise unlocks **event hosting** (a real door)
- Lists unlock **community recognition** (a real door)
- Feedback unlocks **better recommendations** (a real door)
- **No meaningless badges, points, or leaderboards**

### **Core Values**

#### **1. Belonging Comes First**
SPOTS exists to help people find places, experiences, and communities where they truly feel at home—wherever they are. Every spot is a potential door to belonging.

#### **2. No Agenda. No Politics. No Pay-to-Play.**
SPOTS is a neutral, open platform. We don't push trends, politics, or whoever pays the most. **Our suggestions are never for sale.**

#### **3. Authenticity Over Algorithms**
Suggestions are powered by real data—preferences, time spent, feedback—not advertising dollars or hidden motives. We help you discover what you'll actually enjoy.

#### **4. Privacy and Control Are Non-Negotiable**
Your data is yours. You control your preferences, your vibe, and your experience. We use data wisely, securely, and only to make your experience better.

#### **5. Community, Not Just Places**
Every spot is a door to community. Your favorite coffee shop isn't just a recommendation; it's a door to the writers' group. That trivia bar isn't just a spot; it's where you meet your crew.

#### **6. Always Learning With You**
The AI learns **alongside** you—which doors resonate, when you're ready for new doors, how you prefer to open doors. Not learning about you. Learning **with** you.
