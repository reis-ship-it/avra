## 🔗 **How the Five Problems Connect**

**Interconnected Crises:**
1. **Loneliness** ← Exacerbated by phone addiction (social isolation)
2. **Choice Paralysis** ← Exacerbated by phone addiction (endless options)
3. **Workforce Instability** ← Creates economic pressure
4. **Privacy Concerns** ← Erodes trust in technology
5. **Phone Addiction** ← Contributes to all other problems

**The Vicious Cycle:**
- Phone addiction → Social isolation → Loneliness
- Phone addiction → Information overload → Choice paralysis
- Phone addiction → Disconnection from real world → Can't pursue passions
- Privacy concerns → Don't trust platforms → Can't use technology effectively
- Workforce instability → Economic pressure → Need new income sources

**SPOTS Breaks the Cycle:**
- Uses technology to help people disconnect from technology
- Privacy-preserving approach builds trust
- Economic enablement creates new income sources
- Real-world focus addresses phone addiction
- Community connection addresses loneliness
