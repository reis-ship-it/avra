## 💡 **Recommendations**

### **Option 1: Keep Current 5 Problems (Recommended)**

**Why:** Your 5 problems are comprehensive and well-chosen. They cover the core issues SPOTS addresses.

**Enhancement:** Add supporting statistics and related problems as context:
- Mention "friendship recession" when discussing loneliness
- Mention "mental health crisis" as impact of loneliness + phone addiction
- Mention "third places decline" when discussing community connection
- Mention "authenticity crisis" when discussing expertise system

### **Option 2: Expand to 7 Problems**

**Add:**
- **Friendship Recession** - 60% drop in close friendships, directly related to loneliness
- **Mental Health Crisis** - 23% of adults, 160M underserved, SPOTS addresses root causes

**Why:** These are massive, well-documented problems that SPOTS directly addresses. They're distinct enough from loneliness to warrant separate mention.

**Risk:** May dilute focus. Your current 5 are already comprehensive.

### **Option 3: Reframe Current Problems**

**Keep 5, but reframe:**
1. **Loneliness & Friendship Recession** (combine, emphasize both)
2. **Choice Paralysis & Information Overload** (combine, emphasize both)
3. **Workforce Instability & Expertise Recognition Gap** (combine, emphasize both)
4. **Privacy Concerns** (keep as-is)
5. **Phone Addiction & Mental Health Crisis** (combine, emphasize connection)

**Why:** Acknowledges related problems without expanding count.

**Current:** "SPOTS helps people discover meaningful places"

**Enhanced:** "SPOTS helps people discover meaningful places—coffee shops, libraries, community centers—the 'third places' that are disappearing but essential for community connection."

### **4. Add Authenticity Crisis to Expertise System**

**Current:** "Expertise system lets users monetize their local knowledge"

**Enhanced:** "In an age of fake connections and curated personas, SPOTS's expertise system recognizes authentic knowledge and contributions—'doors, not badges.' Real expertise, real recognition, real income."
