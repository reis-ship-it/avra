# Parallel Agent Work Guide - Trial Run (Weeks 1-4)

**Date:** November 22, 2025, 8:40 PM CST  
**Purpose:** Complete guide for running 3 agents in parallel on MVP Core  
**Status:** 🚀 Ready to Start

---

## 🚀 **HOW TO START THE TRIAL RUN (3 Simple Steps)**

### **Step 1: Open 3 Cursor Windows/Tabs**
Open 3 separate Cursor windows (or use tabs) - one for each agent.

### **Step 2: Copy & Paste Agent Prompts**
Copy the agent prompt below and paste into each Cursor window:
- **Window 1:** Agent 1 prompt (Payment Backend)
- **Window 2:** Agent 2 prompt (Event UI)
- **Window 3:** Agent 3 prompt (Expertise UI & Testing)

### **Step 3: Let Them Work**
Agents will start working immediately in parallel. They'll coordinate automatically on Day 2 and Week 4.

**That's it!** The agents will work independently and coordinate as needed.

## 🔄 **Dependency Checking & Communication**

### **⚠️ CRITICAL: Always Check Dependencies**

**Before starting ANY task:**
1. Read `docs/AGENT_STATUS_TRACKER.md`
2. Check "Dependency Map" - what do you depend on?
3. Check "Completed Work" - is dependency ready?
4. Check "Blocked Tasks" - are you blocked?

**When completing work others depend on:**
1. Update `docs/AGENT_STATUS_TRACKER.md` immediately
2. Move to "Completed Work" section
3. Update "Dependency Map" - mark as ready
4. Remove from "Blocked Tasks" if it unblocks others

**See:** `docs/DEPENDENCY_CHECKING_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions

---

## 🔄 **Coordination Protocol**

### **Dependency Check Points:**

**Phase 1, Section 1:**
- All agents start independently
- Agent 1: Payment backend (Section 1)
- Agent 2: Event Discovery UI (Section 1)
- Agent 3: Expertise UI (Section 1)
- ✅ All check status tracker before starting

**Phase 1, Section 2:**
- ⚠️ **DEPENDENCY CHECK:** Agent 2 checks status tracker for Agent 1 Section 2
- If Agent 1 Section 2 complete: Agent 2 can start Payment UI
- If not complete: Agent 2 continues Event Discovery UI
- Agent 1: Updates status tracker when Section 2 complete
- Agent 3: Continues independently

**Phase 1, Sections 3-4:**
- All agents continue their work
- Check status tracker before each section
- Update status tracker when completing work

**Phase 2-3:**
- All agents continue independently
- Check status tracker regularly
- Update status tracker when completing work

**Phase 4:**
- ⚠️ **DEPENDENCY CHECK:** Agent 3 checks status tracker - are Phases 1-3 complete?
- If complete: Agent 3 coordinates integration testing
- All agents fix bugs together
- Final integration and polish
