# Tangent Work Directory

This directory contains exploratory work that is not part of the main Master Plan execution sequence.

**Rules:**
- Tangents don't block main plan execution
- Tangents can be promoted to main plan if valuable
- Tangents can be paused/resumed without affecting main plan
- Tangents don't affect dependencies (main plan doesn't wait for tangents)
- Tangents have time limits (e.g., 2-3 hours/week max)
- Tangents have promotion criteria (when does it become main plan?)

**Status Types:**
- 🔬 **Active Tangent** - Currently exploring
- ⏸️ **Paused Tangent** - Temporarily paused (focusing on main plan)
- ✅ **Promoted Tangent** - Became main plan feature
- ❌ **Abandoned Tangent** - Didn't work out, abandoned

**See:** `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md` - "Tangent Work (Exploratory)" section for active tangents
