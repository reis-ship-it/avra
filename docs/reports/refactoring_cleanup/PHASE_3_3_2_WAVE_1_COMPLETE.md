---

## ✅ **Verification Results**

### **File Migration:**
- ✅ All 4 service files in `packages/spots_ai/lib/services/` (1 moved earlier, 3 moved in this session)
- ✅ All 3 old files removed from `lib/core/services/` (contextual_personality was already removed)
- ✅ Package exports updated in `spots_ai.dart` (4 services exported)
- ✅ **All test file imports updated** (11 test files migrated to new package paths)

### **Import Updates:**
- ✅ All imports in moved files verified (no changes needed - already use temporary `spots` dependency)
- ✅ All imports across codebase updated (23 files total: 11 production + 11 test + 1 injection container)
  - **Production files (11):** injection_container, injection_container_ai, controllers, blocs, pages, ai services
  - **Test files (11):** unit tests, integration tests, mock files
  - personality_sync_service: 8 production + 8 test = 16 files
  - ai2ai_realtime_service: 4 production + 1 test = 5 files
  - locality_personality_service: 0 production + 2 test = 2 files
- ✅ No old import paths remain in main codebase or tests (verified with grep)
- ✅ Old imports only exist in `.import_migration_backup/` (backup files - expected)

### **Compilation:**
- ✅ Package exports properly configured
- ✅ All services accessible via `package:spots_ai/services/...`

## 📊 **Progress Summary**

**Wave 1:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (4/4 services: 1 earlier + 3 this session)  
**Overall Phase 3.3.2:** 4/9 services complete (44%)

**Remaining:**
- Wave 2: 2 services (medium complexity)
  - `language_pattern_learning_service.dart` - **CRITICAL:** Must move before personality_agent_chat_service
  - `ai2ai_learning_service.dart` - Medium complexity
- Wave 3: 3 services (high complexity)
  - `personality_agent_chat_service.dart` - Depends on language_pattern_learning_service (Wave 2)
  - `business_business_chat_service_ai2ai.dart` - High complexity, business domain
  - `business_expert_chat_service_ai2ai.dart` - High complexity, business domain

2. `ai2ai_learning_service.dart` - Medium complexity

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours for Wave 2
