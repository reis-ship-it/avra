# Easy Event Hosting System - Explanation

**Date:** November 21, 2025  
**Status:** 🎯 Explanation & Vision  
**Context:** User request to make event hosting incredibly easy for approved businesses and people with expertise

---

## 🎯 **What You're Asking For**

You want two types of users to have an **incredibly easy** time hosting events:

1. **Businesses** - After admin vetting/approval
2. **People** - After reaching expertise level (City level or higher)

**Current State:**
- ✅ Event hosting system exists (`ExpertiseEventService`)
- ✅ Expertise pin system exists (unlocks event hosting at City level)
- ✅ Business account system exists (`BusinessAccount` model)
- ⚠️ **BUT: Event creation process may not be "incredibly easy"**

---

## 🔍 **Current Event Hosting System**

### **For People (Experts):**

**Requirements:**
- Must have **City level or higher** expertise in a category
- Must have expertise in the category they're hosting event for

**Current Process:**
```dart
ExpertiseEventService.createEvent(
  host: user,                      // Must be expert
  title: "Coffee Tasting Tour",
  description: "Visit 3 coffee shops...",
  category: "Coffee",              // Must have expertise in this
  eventType: ExpertiseEventType.tour,
  startTime: DateTime(...),
  endTime: DateTime(...),
  spots: [spot1, spot2, spot3],
  location: "Brooklyn",
  maxAttendees: 20,
  price: 25.00,                    // Optional
  isPublic: true,
);
```

**What's Good:**
- ✅ Expertise system works (unlocks at City level)
- ✅ Event model is comprehensive
- ✅ Validation exists (checks expertise, category match)

**What Could Be Easier:**
- ⚠️ Requires many parameters
- ⚠️ No UI wizard/flow for event creation
- ⚠️ No templates ("Coffee Tour", "Bookstore Walk")
- ⚠️ No quick copy/repeat previous events

---

### **For Businesses:**

**Current State:**
- ✅ `BusinessAccount` model exists
- ✅ `BusinessVerification` system exists
- ⚠️ **Businesses can't currently host events directly**
  - Event hosting is tied to `UnifiedUser` (individuals)
  - No `BusinessEvent` model or service

**Gap Identified:**
Businesses need ability to host events after admin approval, but system is currently user-only.

---

## 🎯 **What "Incredibly Easy" Means**

### **Design Principles:**

1. **One-Tap Event Creation** - Minimal required fields
2. **Smart Templates** - Pre-filled event types
3. **Auto-Fill from Context** - Use location, expertise, past events
4. **Visual Builder** - UI wizard, not form
5. **Copy & Repeat** - Clone successful past events
6. **AI Assistance** - LLM suggests details based on category

---

## 🚀 **Proposed Improvements**

### **1. Event Templates System**

**Concept:**
Pre-built event templates for common event types:

```dart
class EventTemplate {
  final String id;
  final String name;                    // "Coffee Tasting Tour"
  final String category;                // "Coffee"
  final ExpertiseEventType eventType;   // tour
  final String descriptionTemplate;     // "Join me for..."
  final int defaultMaxAttendees;        // 20
  final Duration defaultDuration;       // 2 hours
  final List<String> suggestedSpots;    // Spot types to include
  final double? suggestedPrice;         // null or typical price
}
```

**Example Templates:**
- **Coffee Tasting Tour** (3 spots, 2 hours, $25)
- **Bookstore Walk** (4 spots, 1.5 hours, free)
- **Bar Crawl** (5 spots, 3 hours, $30)
- **Museum Day** (2 spots, 4 hours, $40)
- **Food Tour** (5 spots, 3 hours, $50)
- **Trivia Night** (1 spot, 2 hours, free)
- **Concert/Live Music** (1 spot, 3 hours, $20-50) 🎵 *Cross-ref: See Personality Dimensions for music vibe tracking*
- **Art Gallery Opening** (1-2 spots, 2 hours, free) 🎨 *Cross-ref: See Personality Dimensions for art preference tracking*
- **Sports Event** (1 spot, 3 hours, $30-100) ⚽ *Cross-ref: See Personality Dimensions for team loyalty tracking*

**User Experience:**
```
1. Tap "Host Event"
2. See gallery of templates
3. Select "Coffee Tasting Tour"
4. Pre-filled with defaults
5. Adjust date/time (auto-suggests next weekend)
6. Select spots (shows your top coffee spots)
7. Review and publish (1 tap)
```

**Result:** Event created in 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes.

---

### **2. Quick Event Builder UI**

**Vision:**
A beautiful, simple wizard that feels like Instagram Stories creation.

**Flow:**
```
Step 1: Choose Template (or "Custom")
  → Gallery of event types with icons

Step 2: When & Where
  → Calendar picker (defaults to next weekend)
  → Duration slider (1-4 hours)
  → Starting spot (your favorites shown)

Step 3: What Spots?
  → Drag and drop spots to add
  → AI suggests spots based on category
  → Show your spots with that category

Step 4: Details
  → Title (auto-generated, editable)
  → Description (template, editable)
  → Max attendees slider (10-50)
  → Price toggle (free or $)

Step 5: Publish
  → Preview card
  → One tap to publish
  → Share to community
```

**Design:**
- Large touch targets
- Visual spot cards (not text lists)
- Smart defaults (reduce decisions)
- AI suggestions (but user in control)
- Progress indicator (5 steps)

---

### **3. Copy Previous Events**

**Concept:**
If you've hosted a successful event, make it trivial to host again.

**UI:**
```
Past Events Tab:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Coffee Tasting Tour - Nov 10        │
  │ 12 attendees / $25 / 5.0 rating ✨  │
  │                                      │
  │ [View Details] [Host Again] [Copy]  │
  └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**"Host Again" Action:**
- Copies all event details
- Updates date to next available weekend
- Updates spots if any are closed
- One tap to publish

**"Copy" Action:**
- Opens Quick Builder with all fields pre-filled
- Lets user adjust before publishing

---

### **4. Business Event Hosting**

**New Capability:**
Businesses (after admin approval) can host events at their location.

**Business Event Types:**
- **Product Launch** - "New menu item tasting"
- **Community Night** - "Trivia Tuesday"
- **Workshop** - "Coffee brewing class"
- **Meetup** - "Book club meeting"
- **Live Music Night** - "Local band performance" 🎵 *Cross-ref: Attendees' music preferences tracked in vibe*
- **Art Exhibition** - "Local artist showcase" 🎨 *Cross-ref: Art appreciation tracked in vibe*
- **Sports Viewing** - "Game day watch party" ⚽ *Cross-ref: Team loyalty tracked in vibe*

**Example:**
```
Third Coast Coffee (verified business):
  → Host Event
  → Select "Workshop"
  → "Coffee Brewing Class"
  → Fill: Date/time, capacity, price
  → Publish to community
```

**Requirements:**
- Business must be admin-approved (verification.status == approved)
- Event hosted at business location (can't be tour)
- Business owner can assign staff to manage event

---

### **5. AI-Assisted Event Creation**

**Concept:**
LLM helps fill in details based on category and event type.

**Example:**
```
User: Creates "Coffee Tasting Tour"
AI:
  Title: "Brooklyn Coffee Tour with [Your Name]"
  Description: "Join me for a guided tour of Brooklyn's 
               best coffee shops. We'll visit 3 spots, 
               taste different brewing methods, and discuss 
               coffee culture. Perfect for coffee enthusiasts 
               and newcomers alike!"
  Duration: 2 hours
  Price: $25
  Max Attendees: 15
  Suggested Spots: [Your top 3 coffee spots in Brooklyn]
```

**User Experience:**
- AI pre-fills everything
- User adjusts what they want
- AI learns from past events
- Gets better over time

## 🔗 **Cross-References to Other Plans**

**This plan connects to:**

### **→ Personality Dimensions Plan**
**Why:** Events reveal personality preferences

**Examples:**
- 🎵 **Concerts/Live Music** → Music taste tracked as vibe dimension
  - Genre preferences (indie, rock, electronic, classical)
  - Energy preference (mosh pit vs. seated venue)
  - Novelty seeking (new artists vs. favorite bands)
  
- 🎨 **Art Events** → Cultural preferences tracked
  - Art style preferences (modern, classical, street art)
  - Crowd tolerance (gallery opening vs. private viewing)
  - Value orientation (art appreciation dimension)

- ⚽ **Sports Events** → Social preferences tracked
  - Team loyalty (community bonding)
  - Energy levels (active participation vs. watching)
  - Crowd tolerance (stadium vs. sports bar)

**Action Item:** When user attends/hosts these events, update their vibe profile accordingly.

### **→ Contextual Personality Plan**
**Why:** Events create personality contexts

**Examples:**
- User hosts coffee tours → "Expert Guide" context
- User attends concerts → "Music Enthusiast" context
- User hosts trivia → "Community Builder" context

**Action Item:** Track which contexts emerge from event patterns.

### **→ Philosophy Implementation**
**Why:** Offline event hosting needs to work without internet

**Dependency:** Easy Event Hosting should work offline (Bluetooth check-in, local RSVP)

## 🔗 Related Plans

### **Extension Plan Created:**
**[Event Partnership & Monetization Plan](./EVENT_PARTNERSHIP_MONETIZATION_PLAN.md)** ✅

This plan extends Easy Event Hosting with:
- User-business partnership system
- AI-powered partnership matching
- Payment processing (Stripe integration)
- Revenue sharing (SPOTS platform fee + automatic splits)
- Financial reporting and analytics

**Integration Overview:**
See **[Event System Integration Overview](./EVENT_SYSTEM_INTEGRATION_OVERVIEW.md)** for how these plans work together.

**Key Addition:**
When users and businesses partner to host events, SPOTS earns a **10% platform fee** (plus payment processing pass-through of ~3%) on paid event ticket sales, with the remaining ~87% automatically split between partners based on their agreement (e.g., 50/50, 70/30).

**Fee Transparency:**
- 10% → SPOTS (platform, matching, infrastructure)
- ~3% → Payment processor (Stripe)
- ~87% → Event hosts (split per agreement)
- Total customer cost: ~13%

**This is about making it trivial to open doors for others. When hosting events is this easy, communities flourish.** 🚪✨
