# MBE Systems - Complete Explanation

**Created:** November 21, 2025  
**Purpose:** Clear explanation of Monetization, Business & Expertise systems  
**Audience:** Anyone who needs to understand how these systems work

---

## 🎯 What Are the MBE Systems?

**MBE = Monetization, Business & Expertise**

Three interconnected systems that enable SPOTS to:
1. **Make money** (Monetization)
2. **Connect people and businesses** (Business Partnerships)
3. **Recognize genuine expertise** (Expertise System)

Together, they create a sustainable platform where experts can host events, businesses can partner, brands can sponsor, and SPOTS earns revenue—all while maintaining quality and trust.

## 💰 System 1: Monetization

### **The Simple Rule:**

> **SPOTS takes 10% on EVERY paid transaction, no exceptions.**

### **What Gets Charged 10%:**

- Event tickets ($75 ticket → $7.50 to SPOTS)
- Walking tours ($25 tour → $2.50 to SPOTS)
- Workshops ($35 workshop → $3.50 to SPOTS)
- Products sold ($25 item → $2.50 to SPOTS)
- Sponsor contributions ($500 → $50 to SPOTS)
- **Anything paid on SPOTS**

### **How It Works:**

```
User hosts event: $500 revenue
├─ Stripe processing fee: ~$20 (2.9% + $0.30)
├─ SPOTS platform fee (10%): $50
└─ User gets: $430
```

**Free events:** No fee (builds community)

### **Why This Matters:**

- **Simple:** One rule, no exceptions
- **Transparent:** Everyone sees exactly what SPOTS takes
- **Fair:** 10% is competitive with other platforms
- **Sustainable:** Platform can operate and grow

## 🤝 System 2: Business Partnerships

### **The Big Picture:**

People and businesses can work together to host events, and everyone gets paid fairly.

### **Partnership Types:**

#### **1. 2-Party Partnership (Simple)**
```
Expert + Restaurant
├─ Expert creates event
├─ Restaurant provides venue
├─ They split revenue (e.g., 60/40)
└─ SPOTS takes 10% of total
```

#### **2. N-Party Sponsorship (Complex)**
```
Influencer + Restaurant + Oil Company
├─ Influencer hosts dinner event
├─ Restaurant provides venue
├─ Oil Company sponsors (pays $500 OR provides product)
├─ All three split revenue
└─ SPOTS takes 10% of everything
```

### **Key Features:**

#### **A. User Can Invite Businesses**
- Expert wants to host at a coffee shop
- Searches for venue in app
- If business is on SPOTS: "Add as Partner" (instant)
- If business is NOT on SPOTS: "Invite to SPOTS" (earn $50!)

#### **B. Referral Program**
When user gets a business to sign up:
- **$50** immediate bonus
- **10%** of business's first event earnings
- **Maximum:** $200 total per referral

#### **C. Pre-Event Split Locking**
**CRITICAL:** All revenue splits must be agreed BEFORE event starts
- User proposes: "I get 60%, you get 40%"
- Business can accept, decline, or counter
- Once everyone agrees → **LOCKED**
- Cannot change after event starts
- Event can't go live until locked

#### **D. Vibe Matching (70%+ Compatibility)**
- System only suggests partnerships if personalities/values match
- Reduces spam and bad matches
- Both parties can still say no
- But system won't suggest incompatible partners

#### **E. Separate UIs**
- **User Interface:** For event hosts and attendees
- **Business Interface:** For venues and shops
- **Company Interface:** For brands looking to sponsor

Each interface shows what's relevant to that role.

### **Complete Example:**

**Sarah (coffee expert) wants to host workshop:**

1. Creates event in app
2. Searches for venue: "Brew Haven"
3. App shows: "⚠️ Not on SPOTS"
4. Sarah clicks "Invite to SPOTS"
5. Brew Haven gets email: "Sarah wants to host $35 workshop. Join SPOTS to earn $182!"
6. Brew Haven signs up (5 minutes)
7. Sarah gets $50 referral bonus
8. They agree on 50/50 split
9. Agreement LOCKED
10. Event goes live
11. 15 people attend = $525 revenue
12. SPOTS gets $52.50 (10%)
13. Sarah gets $236.25 (50% of net)
14. Brew Haven gets $236.25 (50% of net)
15. Sarah also gets $23.63 (10% of Brew Haven's earnings)

**Total for Sarah:** $309.88  
**Total for Brew Haven:** $236.25  
**Total for SPOTS:** $52.50

## 🎓 System 3: Expertise

### **The Core Idea:**

> **Not everyone can host events. You need to be a genuine expert. But there are many ways to become an expert—not just visiting places.**

### **Why This Matters:**

- **Early on:** Need experts to bootstrap platform (easy requirements)
- **Later:** Too many "experts" dilutes trust (harder requirements)
- **Solution:** Requirements scale with platform growth

### **Six Paths to Expertise:**

#### **Path 1: Exploration (40% weight)**
**Traditional way:** Visit places and review them
- Automatic check-ins (no phone needed!)
- Dwell time matters (longer = better)
- Reviews boost your score
- **Example:** 50 coffee shop visits → Expert

#### **Path 2: Credentials (25% weight)**
**Education and certifications:**
- University degrees (BA, MS, PhD)
- Professional certifications (Q Grader, Sommelier)
- Published work (articles, books)
- **Example:** PhD in Food Science → Expert

#### **Path 3: Influence (20% weight)**
**Social proof:**
- Instagram/TikTok followers (verified)
- SPOTS followers and list shares
- Curated lists that others save
- **Example:** 50K Instagram followers + coffee content → Expert

#### **Path 4: Professional (25% weight)**
**Proof of work in the field:**
- **Chefs** (head chef, sous chef, executive)
- **Writers** (food critics, art critics, journalists)
- **Educators** (professors, teachers, coaches, mentors)
- **Consultants** (industry specialists)
- **Arts** (curators, gallerists, museum directors)
- **Healthcare** (doctors, nurses, therapists)

**All need proof:** LinkedIn, employer letter, license, portfolio, or peer endorsements

**Example:** Head chef at Michelin restaurant (verified) → Expert

#### **Path 5: Community (15% weight)**
**Helping others:**
- Answer questions
- Host successful events
- Curate quality lists
- Get peer endorsements
- **Example:** Hosted 10 successful events + answered 50 questions → Expert

#### **Path 6: Golden Local Expert (Special)**
**25+ continuous years living in one place:**
- Special designation
- Can review/curate events for their area
- Advisory board membership
- Community guide
- **Example:** 32 years in Williamsburg, Brooklyn → Golden Local Expert

### **Automatic Check-Ins (No Phone Needed!)**

**How it works:**
1. You walk into coffee shop
2. Phone detects you're nearby (geofencing)
3. Bluetooth confirms you're actually there (ai2ai)
4. System tracks how long you stay (dwell time)
5. Visit automatically logged
6. Optional: Review prompt 2 hours later

**You don't need to:**
- Pull out your phone
- Manually check in
- Do anything

**It just works automatically.**

### **Dynamic Scaling:**

**As platform grows, requirements increase:**

| Platform Size | Visits Needed | Ratings Needed | Avg Rating |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| <1K users    | 10            | 5              | 4.0★       |
| 1K-10K       | 20            | 10             | 4.2★       |
| 10K-100K     | 35            | 20             | 4.3★       |
| 100K+        | 50            | 35             | 4.5★       |

**Why:** Prevents oversaturation. "Expert" means something valuable.

### **Locality-Based Expertise:**

**Expertise is location-specific:**

```
Sarah's Coffee Visits:
├─ Brooklyn: 45 visits → City-level ✅ (can host)
├─ Manhattan: 5 visits → Enthusiast (cannot host)
└─ Queens: 2 visits → Novice (cannot host)
```

**Can only host events where you're truly expert.**

### **Sophisticated Saturation Algorithm:**

**Not just:** "Too many experts? Make it harder"

**Instead:** Six factors considered:
1. How many experts exist (supply)
2. Are they actually good? (quality)
3. Are they being used? (utilization)
4. Do users want more? (demand)
5. Is growth healthy? (velocity)
6. Are they spread out? (geography)

**Result:** Smart recommendations, not just "increase/decrease"
