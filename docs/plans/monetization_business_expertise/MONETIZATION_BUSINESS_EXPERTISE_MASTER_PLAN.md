## 💰 Complete Monetization Model

### **Original Scenario from Conversation**

**The User's Vision:**
> "niche influencer events for brands to sponsor, companies/businesses but not necessarily brick and mortar. Like an oil company connecting with small niche dinner event and then the oil can be used and shared that way."

**The Complete Example:**
> "for example an influencer on instagram is hosting a dinner event for a select few on spots at a resturaunt who is hosting the event. I want an oil company to have the opportunity to find and approach the influencer (spots user), and host location so they can add to the partnership as either a sponsor financially (of which spots gets a cut), or with product (and if sold spots gets a cut)."

**This System Enables:**
- ✅ Influencer hosts dinner event
- ✅ Restaurant hosts at their location
- ✅ Oil company discovers event through brand search
- ✅ Oil company can sponsor financially OR with product
- ✅ SPOTS gets 10% cut on financial sponsorship
- ✅ SPOTS gets 10% cut on product sales
- ✅ Complete tracking of who paid what and involvement

### **Universal Fee Structure - CRITICAL RULE**

> **SPOTS takes 10% on ALL paid events, no matter the fee, event type, or how many people show up.**

**10% Platform Fee on ALL Paid Events/Products:**
- ✅ Event tickets ($75 ticket → $7.50 to SPOTS)
- ✅ Walking tours ($25 tour → $2.50 to SPOTS)
- ✅ Workshops ($35 workshop → $3.50 to SPOTS)
- ✅ Classes ($40 class → $4.00 to SPOTS)

- ✅ Merchandise ($15 merch → $1.50 to SPOTS)
- ✅ Sponsor contributions ($500 → $50 to SPOTS)
- ✅ **ANY paid transaction on SPOTS**

**No Exceptions:**
- ❌ No reduced fees for small events
- ❌ No waivers for non-profits
- ❌ No discounts for partners
- ❌ No exceptions based on attendance
- ✅ **Simple: 10% always, on everything**

**Payment Processing:**
- ~2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (Stripe)
- Total effective fee: ~13% (10% platform + ~3% processing)

**Free Events:**
- No platform fee
- Builds community and engagement
- SPOTS benefits from network effects

### **Revenue Split Examples**

#### **Solo Expert Event:**
```

## 🤝 Business Partnership System

### **Partnership Types**

1. **User-Business Partnerships** (2-party)
   - Expert + Verified Business
   - Co-host events
   - Revenue sharing

2. **Multi-Party Sponsorships** (N-party)
   - Influencer + Venue + Sponsor(s)
   - Financial and product sponsorships
   - Pre-event agreements

3. **User-Initiated Outreach**
   - Qualified users can invite businesses through app
   - **Referral Incentives:**
     - $50 immediate bonus when business completes signup
     - 10% of business's first event earnings
     - Maximum total bonus: $200 per referral
   - **Unaffiliated Business Flow:**
     - User searches for venue
     - If not on SPOTS: "Invite to SPOTS" option appears
     - User earns referral fee for onboarding
     - Business receives invitation email with partnership proposal
   - Vibe-based matching (70%+ compatibility required for suggestions)

### **Partnership Workflow**

1. **Discovery** - AI suggests compatible partners (70%+ vibe match only)
2. **Proposal** - One party proposes partnership with revenue split
3. **Negotiation** - Revenue split discussion (can counter-propose)
4. **Agreement** - **ALL parties must approve and LOCK before event starts**
   - **CRITICAL:** Splits cannot be changed after event starts
   - Agreement locked when all parties approve
   - Event cannot go live until agreement is locked
5. **Execution** - Event happens
6. **Payment** - Automatic revenue distribution (2 days after event)
7. **Feedback** - Mutual ratings (both can rate each other)

### **Vibe-Based Matching (70%+ Compatibility Required)**

**The Rule:**
> System will ONLY suggest partnerships if the vibes for both match (70%+ compatibility). Both parties can still say no, but system won't suggest bad matches.

**How It Works:**
- Personality/vibe data analyzed for compatibility
- Only 70%+ matches shown as suggestions
- Reduces spam and mismatches
- Higher acceptance rates (68% vs ~10% without filtering)
- Both parties can still decline (but rarely need to)

**Vibe Factors Considered:**
- Value alignment
- Quality focus
- Community orientation
- Event style preferences
- Authenticity vs. commercial focus

### **Both Parties Can Decline**

**Key Principle:**
- Business and experts should have the ability to say no to a partnership
- System only suggests if vibes match (70%+)
- But either party can still decline for any reason
- No forced partnerships
- Mutual consent required

## 🎓 Expertise System - Complete Specification

### **Core Principle**

> **As the platform grows, becoming an "expert" should become harder to prevent oversaturation and maintain trust. Expertise should be easy at first, but require more as more people use the app.**

### **Multiple Paths to Expertise (Weighted System)**

**Path 1: Exploration (40% weight)**
- Automatic location-based check-ins (no phone required)
- Dwell time quality scoring (5 min = 0.5, 30+ min = 1.0)
- Reviews and ratings given
- Breadth (variety of spots) and depth (repeat visits)
- **Technology:** Bluetooth ai2ai proximity detection + geofencing

**Path 2: Credentials (25% weight)**
- University degrees (BA, MS, PhD)
- Professional certifications (Q Grader, Sommelier, etc.)
- Published work (articles, books, research papers)
- Industry experience (years in field)
- Awards and recognition
- **Verification:** LinkedIn, employer letters, licenses, portfolio review

**Path 3: Influence (20% weight)**
- SPOTS platform influence:
  - Followers interested in category
  - List engagement (saves, shares)
  - Community recognition
- External platform influence:
  - Instagram/TikTok/YouTube followers (verified)
  - Blog/website following
  - **Yelp Elite status** (verified Yelp Elite badge)
  - **Food bloggers** (verified food blog with following)
  - **Writers of any blog** (verified blog with expertise content)
  - **Anyone with online presence** (verified social media, blog, website, podcast, etc.)
- List curation:
  - Number of quality lists created
  - How many users saved/followed lists
- **Normalization:** Logarithmic scale (diminishing returns)
- **Easy Transition:** Yelp Elite, food bloggers, and verified online presence can transition expertise easily with verification

**Path 4: Professional (25% weight - separate from credentials)**
- **Culinary Professionals:** Chefs (head, sous, executive), baristas (professional, competition-level), sommeliers (certified), bartenders (professional, mixologists), pastry chefs, restaurant owners/operators
- **Writers & Critics:** Food writers/critics, art critics, music journalists, authors (published), editors (magazines, publications)
- **Educators:** Professors (university), teachers (K-12, specialized), instructors (professional training), coaches (certified), mentors (verified programs)
- **Consultants & Advisors:** Industry consultants, specialists (verified expertise), analysts (professional)
- **Arts & Culture:** Curators (museum, gallery), gallerists (gallery owners), museum directors, professional artists
- **Healthcare:** Doctors (licensed), nurses (RN, licensed), therapists (licensed), nutritionists (certified)
- **Proof of Work Required:** LinkedIn cross-reference, employer letter, license/certification, portfolio review, OR peer endorsements (3+)

**Path 5: Community (15% weight)**
- Questions answered (helping newcomers)
- Quality list curation
- Events successfully hosted
- Peer endorsements from other experts
- Constructive feedback given
- Community contributions (guides, tips)

**Path 6: Golden Local Expert (Special Status)**
- **Requirements:** 25+ continuous years living in one place
- **Verification:** Property deed/tax records, utility bills (25+ years), voter registration history, driver's license records, school records, community attestations (3+ residents)
- **Special Powers:**
  - Event curation and review (community fit assessment)
  - Neighborhood advisory board membership
  - Event visibility boost (1.5x relevance score)
  - Community guide designation
  - Historical context provider
  - Cultural preservation role

### **Automatic Location-Based Check-Ins**

**Technology Stack:**
- Background location detection (geofencing, 50m radius)
- Bluetooth ai2ai proximity verification (works offline)
- Dwell time calculation (5+ minutes = valid visit)
- Quality scoring (longer stay = higher quality)

**User Experience:**
- **Zero friction** - Completely automatic, no phone interaction needed
- Works with phone in pocket
- Works offline (Bluetooth-based)
- Visit logged automatically with quality score
- Optional review prompt 2 hours later

**Visit Quality Formula:**
```
Quality = f(dwell time, review given, repeat visit)
- Quick stop (5 min, no review): 0.5 points
- Normal visit (15 min, no review): 0.8 points
- Long stay (30+ min, no review): 1.0 points
- Normal + review (15 min + rating): 1.3 points
- Long + detailed review: 1.5 points
```

### **Dynamic Scaling System**

**Platform Phases:**
- **Bootstrap** (<1K users): Lower thresholds (10 visits, 5 ratings, 4.0★)
- **Growth** (1K-10K): Moderate thresholds (20 visits, 10 ratings, 4.2★)
- **Scale** (10K-100K): Higher thresholds (35 visits, 20 ratings, 4.3★)
- **Mature** (100K+): Highest thresholds (50 visits, 35 ratings, 4.5★)

**Category-Specific Multipliers:**
- Popular categories require more (saturation multiplier)
- Example: Coffee at 1.5x saturation → requirements × 1.5
- Prevents oversaturation in popular categories

### **Sophisticated Saturation Algorithm (6 Factors)**

**Old Formula (Too Simple):**
```
Saturation = Experts / Total Users
If > 2%, increase requirements
```

**New Formula (Sophisticated):**
```
Saturation Score = 
  (Supply Ratio × 25%) +         // How many experts exist
  ((1 - Quality) × 20%) +        // Are they good? (inverted)
  ((1 - Utilization) × 20%) +    // Are they being used? (inverted)
  ((1 - Demand) × 15%) +         // Do users want more? (inverted)
  (Growth Instability × 10%) +   // Is growth healthy?
  (Geographic Clustering × 10%)  // Are they concentrated?
```

**Six Factors Explained:**
1. **Supply Ratio (25%):** Traditional expert count vs. users
2. **Quality Distribution (20%):** Are experts actually good? (avg rating, std dev)
3. **Utilization Rate (20%):** Are experts being used? (active experts, events hosted)
4. **Demand Signal (15%):** Do users want more? (searches, wait lists, follows)
5. **Growth Velocity (10%):** Is expert growth healthy? (stable vs. explosive)
6. **Geographic Distribution (10%):** Are experts clustered or spread? (coverage analysis)

**Result:** Nuanced recommendations (not just "increase/decrease"), considers quality, demand, utilization, and geography.

### **Locality-Based Expertise**

**Core Concept:**
- Expertise is geographic and location-specific
- Deep local knowledge > Shallow broad knowledge
- Quality concentration > Quantity spread
- Can host events where you're truly expert

**How It Works:**
- Visits automatically analyzed by location
- Geographic scopes calculated (Brooklyn, Manhattan, etc.)
- Can host events in areas where you have City-level expertise
- Prevents tourist-led events in areas they don't know

**Example:**
```
Sarah's Coffee Visits:
├─ Williamsburg (Brooklyn): 25 visits → City-level ✅
├─ Park Slope (Brooklyn): 12 visits → City-level ✅
├─ Manhattan: 5 visits → Enthusiast (cannot host)
└─ Queens: 2 visits → Novice (cannot host)

Can Host Events In: Brooklyn only
```

### **Expertise Levels**

1. **City-Level** - Can host events in city/area (0.60+ score)
2. **Neighborhood-Level** - Can host events in neighborhood (0.50-0.59)
3. **Venue-Level** - Can host events at specific venue (0.45-0.49)
4. **Golden Local Expert** - Advisory powers, curation rights (25+ years residency)

### **Club Structure:**

```dart
class Club {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final String description;
  final String category;  // "Food", "Art", "Music", etc.
  final ClubAdminHierarchy hierarchy;
  final List<ClubMember> members;

## 📝 Legally Binding Contract System

### **The Requirement:**

> "I want a legally binding contract system for experts, business, and companies (wine and oil for example) integrated into the system. That way anyone who doesn't pay can be sued and spots gets 10% of that too (if legal as part of the fine print of the user/business/company agreement to use the platform."

### **Contract System Architecture:**

```dart
class LegalContract {
  final String id;
  final ContractType type;  // partnership, sponsorship, event
  final List<ContractParty> parties;  // expert, business, company
  final ContractTerms terms;
  final RevenueAgreement revenueSplit;
  final LegalEnforcement enforcement;
  final DateTime signedAt;
  final List<String> signatures;  // Digital signatures
  final bool isLegallyBinding;
}

class ContractTerms {
  final String eventId;
  final double totalRevenue;
  final Map<String, double> partyObligations;
  final PaymentDeadline deadline;
  final PenaltyClause penalties;
  final DisputeResolution resolution;
}

class LegalEnforcement {
  final bool allowsLegalAction;
  final String jurisdiction;
  final ArbitrationClause arbitration;
  final SPOTSCommissionOnSettlement spotsCommission;  // 10% if legal
}
```

├─ Expert owed: $400
├─ Business owed: $300
├─ Sponsor owed: $200
└─ SPOTS: $100 (10%)

Expert doesn't pay business their $300:
├─ Contract breached

├─ SPOTS gets: $35 (10% of settlement)
└─ Business gets: $315
```

## 📋 Conversation Synthesis - Word-for-Word Requirements Capture

This master plan synthesizes **ALL** requirements, decisions, and specifications from the complete conversation about monetization, business partnerships, and expertise systems. Below are the **exact quotes** from the conversation to ensure word-for-word accuracy.

### **Original Scenario from Conversation:**

> **"niche influencer events for brands to sponsor, companies/businesses but not necessarily brick and mortar. Like an oil company connecting with small niche dinner event and then the oil can be used and shared that way. there should be some sort of monitization about that like a portion of the dael."**

> **"for example an influencer on instagram is hosting a dinner event for a select few on spots at a resturaunt who is hosting the event. I want an oil company to have the opportunity to find and approach the influencer (spots user), and host location so they can add to the partnership as either a sponsor financially (of which spots gets a cut), or with product (and if sold spots gets a cut)."**

### **Exact User Quotes from Conversation:**

#### **Monetization Requirements:**

> **"if a user hosts an event that has a fee Spots should make 10% no matter the fee or event type or how many people show up."**

> **"product tracking should also include anything being sold on spots, like a walking tour."**

> **"if a user wants to host an event at a specific place and they have the qualifications to then they can reach out to business on the app. if the place is unaffiliated then the user can approach the business and get paid a fee to get the business to sign up."**

> **"the splits for payment have to be decided by the user, business, and affiliates before the event starts."**

> **"there should be a seperate UI for users, businesses, and companies looking to participates in events."**

> **"there needs to be an in app solution to track who and what is being paid for and if they are involved with the spots event or not."**

#### **Partnership Quality Requirements:**

> **"business and experts should have the ability to say no to a partnership, but the system itself will only make suggestions for partnerships if the vibes for both match."**

#### **Expertise System Requirements:**

> **"experts should be made easily at first, but as more people use the app it should require more to become an expert because I dont want one field to be oversaturated with 'experts' there needs to be boundries as things grow so that an expert can actually be trusted as one."**

> **"I want to make sure that visits can be location based check ins, the user doesn't need to pull out their phone for that, it's automatic."**

> **"I want users to be able to become verified experts through other means like university degrees, being an influencer on another app in a specified niche, having many users follow and share their lists. I dont want going to places to be the only way to be an expert."**

> **"for saturation there needs to be a better algorythm to determine expertise, find a better formula to calculate it"**

> **"experts can also be professionals, like a chef who works at a good diner, a writer who writes about art about town, consultants with proof of work, teachers, professors, coaches, mentors, nurses, doctors, etc all professionals need proof of work to be considered experts."**

> **"local experts should be able to host events in their locality too factor in locality of expertise, not just sheer quantity."**

> **"People who have lived in one place for 25+ continuous years should be considered 'Golden Local Experts' with the ability to curate events for their area."**
