- Optimal Threshold: **0.210**

### Analysis

**Key Insights:**
1. **Optimizing internal quantum weights** significantly improves accuracy (95.56%)
2. **Topological integration with weighted average** decreases matching accuracy (42.48%)
3. **Topological improvements** (multiplicative, two-stage) provide small gains (+0.13%)
4. **Quantum-only is already excellent** - limited room for improvement
5. **Topological compatibility** is not beneficial for binary matching but helps with discovery

**Root Cause:**
- Topological structure helps with **discovery** (recommendations)
- But doesn't help with **binary matching** (compatible/incompatible)
- Knot topology adds noise to matching decisions when used as direct combination
- Works better as refinement (multiplicative) or filter (two-stage)

### Recommendations

1. ✅ **Use Quantum-Only for Matching:**
   - Achieves **95.56% accuracy** with optimized weights
   - Optimal threshold: **0.297**
   - Simple, effective, accurate

2. ✅ **Optional: Use Multiplicative Integration:**
   - Achieves **95.68% accuracy** (+0.13% improvement)
   - Uses topological as refinement, not direct combination
   - Small but consistent improvement

3. ✅ **Use Integrated for Recommendations:**
   - Shows **+35.71% improvement** in engagement
   - Topological structure helps discovery
   - Better user experience

4. ✅ **Hybrid Approach (Recommended):**
   - Matching: Quantum-only (95.56%) or Multiplicative (95.68%)
   - Recommendations: Integrated (70% quantum, 30% topological)
