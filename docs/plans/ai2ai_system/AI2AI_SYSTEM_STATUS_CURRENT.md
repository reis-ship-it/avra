- ⚠️ Advertising needs native implementation

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium

#### **Web WebRTC Signaling Server**
- ⚠️ Structure ready in `PersonalityAdvertisingService`
- ⚠️ Requires deployment of WebRTC signaling server
- ✅ Configuration system ready
- ⚠️ Server needs to be deployed at `wss://signaling.spots.app` (or custom URL)

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium

#### **Android WiFi Direct**
- ⚠️ Structure ready in `AndroidDeviceDiscovery`
- ⚠️ Requires native Android code for full peer discovery
- ✅ Basic WiFi checking works
