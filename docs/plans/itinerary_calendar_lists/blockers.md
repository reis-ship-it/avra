## ⚠️ Potential Risks

### **Technical Risks:**
1. **Calendar View Complexity**
   - Risk: Multiple view modes may be complex to implement
   - Mitigation: Start with days/nights view, add others incrementally

2. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Risk: Existing lists must continue to work
   - Mitigation: All calendar fields optional, migration logic included

3. **Performance**
   - Risk: Large itineraries may impact calendar rendering
   - Mitigation: Lazy loading, pagination, optimization

### **Timeline Risks:**
1. **UI Complexity**
   - Risk: Calendar views may take longer than estimated
   - Mitigation: Prototype early, iterate based on feedback

2. **Integration Complexity**
   - Risk: Integration with existing systems may reveal issues
   - Mitigation: Early integration testing, incremental approach
