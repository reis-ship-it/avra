**Goal:** Implement timing flexibility that allows highly meaningful experiences to override timing constraints, with atomic timing and enhanced quantum temporal compatibility.

**Work:**
1. **Timing Flexibility Factor with Atomic Time and Quantum Temporal States:**
   ```dart
   timing_flexibility_factor = {
     1.0 if timing_match ≥ 0.7 OR meaningful_experience_score ≥ 0.8,
     0.5 if meaningful_experience_score ≥ 0.9 (highly meaningful experiences override timing),
     weighted_combination(
       F(ρ_user_timing(t_atomic_user), ρ_event_timing(t_atomic_event)),  // EntityTimingQuantumState compatibility (weight: 0.6)
       C_temporal(ψ_temporal_user(t_atomic_user), ψ_temporal_event(t_atomic_event))  // QuantumTemporalState compatibility (weight: 0.4)
     ) otherwise
   }
   
   Where:
   - t_atomic_user = Atomic timestamp of user timing preference
   - t_atomic_event = Atomic timestamp of event timing
   - F(ρ_user_timing, ρ_event_timing) = EntityTimingQuantumState compatibility (from Section 19.3)
   - C_temporal = |⟨ψ_temporal_user|ψ_temporal_event⟩|² (QuantumTemporalState compatibility from Phase 8)
   - ψ_temporal = |t_atomic⟩ ⊗ |t_quantum⟩ ⊗ |t_phase⟩ (full quantum temporal state)
   ```
   
   **Integration Strategy:**
   - Use `EntityTimingQuantumState` for preference-based timing compatibility (simplified, fast)
   - Use `QuantumTemporalState` for advanced temporal compatibility (full quantum temporal state with phase)
   - Combine both for enhanced accuracy: `timing_compatibility = 0.6 * entity_timing_compat + 0.4 * quantum_temporal_compat`

2. **Meaningful Experience Score:**
   ```dart
   meaningful_experience_score = weighted_average(
     F(ρ_user, ρ_entangled) (weight: 0.40),  // Core compatibility
     F(ρ_user_vibe, ρ_event_vibe) (weight: 0.30),  // Vibe alignment
     F(ρ_user_interests, ρ_event_category) (weight: 0.20),  // Interest alignment
     transformative_potential (weight: 0.10)  // Potential for meaningful connection
   )
   ```

3. **Transformative Potential Calculation:**
   ```dart
   transformative_potential = f(
     event_novelty_for_user,
     user_growth_potential,
     connection_opportunity,
     vibe_expansion_potential
   )
   ```

   - Combine with `EntityTimingQuantumState` compatibility for enhanced accuracy
   - Use timezone-aware matching (local time for cross-timezone compatibility)

5. **Integration into User Calling:**
   - Update user calling formula to include `timing_flexibility_factor`
   - Highly meaningful experiences (score ≥ 0.9) can override timing constraints
