# Reservation System Implementation Plan

**Date:** November 27, 2025, 12:19 PM CST  
**Last Updated:** January 1, 2026 (Gap fixes + Quantum entanglement integration)  
**Status:** 📋 **COMPREHENSIVE PLAN WITH GAP FIXES + QUANTUM ENHANCEMENTS - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

**Quantum Enhancement:** ✅ **FULL QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT INTEGRATION ADDED**
- See `PHASE_15_QUANTUM_ENTANGLEMENT_ENHANCEMENT.md` for detailed quantum integration
- See `PHASE_15_QUANTUM_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` for quick reference  
**Purpose:** Complete implementation plan for reservation system allowing users to make reservations to any and all places in SPOTS

**Gap Analysis:** All 18 identified gaps have been integrated into the plan. See gap fixes marked throughout phases.

**CRITICAL UPDATE (November 27, 2025):** This plan now uses **agentId** (not userId) for all internal tracking, with optional **EventUserData** for business/host requirements. This dual identity system applies to ALL event types: Reservations, Community Events, Club Events, Expert Events, Business Events, Company Events.

---

## 🔐 **DUAL IDENTITY SYSTEM (agentId + Optional User Data)**

### **Overview**

**Security Implementation (Phase 7.3) requires:**
- Use `agentId` for all internal SPOTS tracking (privacy-protected)
- No personal information in AI2AI network
- Complete anonymity for AI2AI connections

**Event System (ALL Event Types) requires:**
- Businesses/hosts may need real user data (name, phone, email, birthday) for reservations/events
- Users should have control over what data to share per reservation/event

### **The Solution: Dual Identity Pattern**

**Internal SPOTS Tracking (agentId):**
- Use `agentId` for all internal tracking (privacy-protected)
- Never share `agentId` with businesses/hosts
- Applies to: Reservations, Community Events, Club Events, Expert Events, Business Events, Company Events

**Optional User Data Sharing (EventUserData):**
- Users can optionally share: name, phone, email, birthday, company affiliation
- User controls what to share per reservation/event
- Data encrypted and only shared if user consents
- Applies to: Reservations, Community Events, Club Events, Expert Events, Business Events, Company Events

### **User Flow:**

```
User registers/reserves for event (any type)
  ↓
Event/host requires data? (name, phone, email, etc.)
  ↓
YES → Show user data sharing options
  ↓
User chooses what to share
  ↓
Store: agentId (internal) + EventUserData (optional, user-controlled)
  ↓
Share EventUserData with host (if user consented)
  ↓
Keep agentId internal (never share with host)
```

### **Applies To:**
- ✅ **Reservations** (Phase 9)
- ✅ **Community Events** (existing system - needs update)
- ✅ **Club Events** (existing/future - needs update)
- ✅ **Expert Events** (existing ExpertiseEvent - needs update)
- ✅ **Business Events** (existing/future - needs update)
- ✅ **Company Events** (existing/future - needs update)

**Reference:** `docs/MASTER_PLAN_GAP_FILLING_EXPLANATION.md` for complete explanation

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Goal:** Enable users to make reservations to any spot, business, or event in SPOTS - opening doors to experiences through seamless booking.

**Philosophy Alignment:** 
- **"Doors, not badges"** - Reservations are doors to experiences at spots
- **"The key opens doors"** - Reservation system is a key that opens doors to places
- **"Spots → Community → Life"** - Reservations help users access their spots and communities

**Scope:**
- Reservations for any Spot (restaurants, bars, venues, etc.)
- Reservations for Business Accounts (verified businesses)
- Reservations for Events (expertise events)
- **Offline-first ticket system** - Internal ticket queue for limited seats (offline users can still get tickets)
- **Free by default** - Reservations are free unless business/expert requires a fee
- **SPOTS fee** - 10% of ticket fee (if paid reservation)
- **Cancellation policies** - Businesses can set own policies, baseline 24-hour policy available
- **Dispute system** - For extenuating circumstances (injury, illness, death)
- **No-show handling** - Fee required, possible expertise rating impact
- **Reservation limits** - Unlimited different reservations, one per event/spot (multiple tickets per reservation)
- **Optional deposits** - Businesses can require deposits (SPOTS takes 10% of deposit)
- **Seating charts** - Optional feature for businesses (concerts, galas, etc.)

**Timeline:** 12-15 weeks (phased approach, updated due to gap fixes)  
**Priority:** P1 - High Value Feature  
**Gap Fixes:** All 18 gaps integrated into plan phases

## 📚 Architecture References

**⚠️ MANDATORY:** This plan aligns with SPOTS architecture:

- **Online/Offline Strategy:** [`../architecture/ONLINE_OFFLINE_STRATEGY.md`](../architecture/ONLINE_OFFLINE_STRATEGY.md) - 83% offline-first
- **Architecture Index:** [`../architecture/ARCHITECTURE_INDEX.md`](../architecture/ARCHITECTURE_INDEX.md) - Central index
- **SPOTS Philosophy:** [`../philosophy_implementation/SPOTS_PHILOSOPHY_AND_ARCHITECTURE.md`](../philosophy_implementation/SPOTS_PHILOSOPHY_AND_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Doors philosophy

## 🚪 Philosophy: Reservations as Doors

**Every reservation is a door:**
- A door to a spot you want to visit
- A door to an experience you're ready for
- A door to a community gathering
- A door to a business you trust

**The AI learns:**
- Which spots you reserve (doors you're ready to open)
- When you make reservations (timing patterns)
- What types of reservations resonate (restaurants, events, venues)
- How reservations lead to more doors (spot → community → events)

**Not just booking - door opening:**
- Reservations aren't just transactions
- They're commitments to open doors
- They show intent to engage with spots/communities
- They're signals of readiness for experiences

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Foundation - Models & Core Service (Weeks 1-2)

### **1.0 Atomic Clock Service** (Week 1, Day 1) - **CRITICAL FOUNDATION - APP-WIDE**

**File:** `lib/core/services/atomic_clock_service.dart`

**Purpose:** Synchronized atomic clock across entire SPOTS app for exact timestamp recognition with nanosecond/millisecond precision - enables true first-come-first-served for offline/online ticket purchases and exact time tracking across all systems

**Precision:**
- **Target:** Nanosecond precision (if platform supports)
- **Fallback:** Millisecond precision (if nanoseconds not available)
- **Platform Support:** Check platform capabilities, use highest available precision

**Why Critical:**
- Offline users need exact purchase time to compare with online users
- First-come-first-served must be truly universal (online and offline)
- Payment processing depends on accurate timestamps
- Queue conflict resolution requires synchronized time
- **AI2AI system** needs exact connection timestamps for learning effectiveness
- **Live tracker** needs exact location/activity timestamps
- **Admin systems** need exact timestamps for all operations
- **Everything** that needs exact time tracking uses this service

**Core Methods:**
```dart
class AtomicClockService {
  // Get synchronized timestamp (atomic across app, nanosecond/millisecond precision)
  Future<AtomicTimestamp> getAtomicTimestamp();
  
  // Sync with server time (when online)
  Future<void> syncWithServer();
  
  // Get time offset (device time vs. server time)
  Duration getTimeOffset();
  
  // Check if clock is synchronized
  bool isSynchronized();
  
  // Get timestamp for ticket purchase (with atomic guarantee)
  Future<AtomicTimestamp> getTicketPurchaseTimestamp();
  
  // Get timestamp for AI2AI connection (exact connection time)
  Future<AtomicTimestamp> getAI2AIConnectionTimestamp();
  
  // Get timestamp for live tracking (exact location/activity time)
  Future<AtomicTimestamp> getLiveTrackingTimestamp();
  
  // Get timestamp for admin operations (exact operation time)
  Future<AtomicTimestamp> getAdminOperationTimestamp();
  
  // Get precision level (nanosecond or millisecond)
  TimePrecision getPrecision();
}
```

**Model:**
```dart
class AtomicTimestamp {
  final DateTime serverTime; // Server-synchronized time (nanosecond/millisecond precision)
  final DateTime deviceTime; // Device time (nanosecond/millisecond precision)
  final Duration offset; // Offset between device and server
  final String timestampId; // Unique ID for this timestamp
  final bool isSynchronized; // Whether clock is synced
  final TimePrecision precision; // nanosecond or millisecond
  final int nanoseconds; // Nanoseconds component (if available)
  final int milliseconds; // Milliseconds component (always available)
}

enum TimePrecision {
  nanosecond, // Nanosecond precision available
  millisecond, // Millisecond precision (fallback)
}
```

**Synchronization Strategy:**
- **When Online:** Sync with server time on app start and periodically (every 30 seconds)
- **When Offline:** Use device time + last known offset
- **Precision Detection:** Check platform capabilities on initialization
- **On Ticket Purchase:** Get atomic timestamp (server time if synced, device time + offset if offline)
- **On AI2AI Connection:** Get atomic timestamp for exact connection time
- **On Live Tracking:** Get atomic timestamp for exact location/activity time
- **On Admin Operations:** Get atomic timestamp for exact operation time
- **On Sync:** Recalculate offsets and resolve conflicts

**App-Wide Integration:**
- ✅ **Reservations:** `ReservationTicketQueueService` for queue ordering
- ✅ **Payments:** `PaymentService` for payment timestamps
- ✅ **AI2AI System:** `ConnectionOrchestrator`, `ConnectionMetrics`, `AI2AIChatAnalyzer` for connection timestamps
- ✅ **Live Tracker:** Location tracking, activity tracking, movement patterns
- ✅ **Admin Systems:** `AdminGodModeService`, `AdminCommunicationService` for all admin operations
- ✅ **Automatic Check-In:** `AutomaticCheckInService` for check-in timestamps
- ✅ **Visit Tracking:** Visit start/end times
- ✅ **Event Tracking:** Event creation, registration, attendance times
- ✅ **Analytics:** All analytics timestamps
- ✅ **Monitoring:** Connection monitoring, network analytics timestamps

**AI2AI System Integration:**
- Connection start/end times (exact compatibility check moments)
- Learning exchange timestamps (exact learning moments)
- Interaction event timestamps (exact interaction times)
- Connection duration calculations (precise duration tracking)

**Live Tracker Integration:**
- Location update timestamps (exact location moments)
- Activity timestamps (exact activity start/end)
- Movement pattern timestamps (exact movement moments)
- Geofence trigger timestamps (exact entry/exit times)

**Admin System Integration:**
- All admin operation timestamps (exact operation times)
- Real-time data stream timestamps (exact data moments)
- AI snapshot timestamps (exact snapshot times)
- User data update timestamps (exact update times)
- Business operation timestamps (exact business operation times)

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ `AtomicClockService` (nanosecond/millisecond precision)
- ✅ `AtomicTimestamp` model (with precision information)
- ✅ `TimePrecision` enum
- ✅ Server time synchronization (high precision)
- ✅ Offline time offset management
- ✅ Timestamp ID generation
- ✅ **AI2AI system integration**

class ReservationService {
  // Create reservation (free by default, business can require fee)
  Future<Reservation> createReservation({
    required ReservationType type,
    required String targetId,
    required DateTime reservationTime,
    required int partySize,
    int? ticketCount, // Can be different from partySize if business has limit
    String? specialRequests,
    double? ticketPrice, // Only if business requires fee
    double? depositAmount, // Optional deposit
    String? seatId, // If seating chart used
  });
  
  // Get user's reservations
  // CRITICAL: Uses agentId (not userId) for privacy-protected internal tracking

    String? agentId, // Uses agentId, not userId
    ReservationStatus? status,
    DateTime? startDate,
    DateTime? endDate,
  });
  
  // Get reservations for a spot/business/event
  Future<List<Reservation>> getReservationsForTarget({
    required ReservationType type,
    required String targetId,
    DateTime? date,
    ReservationStatus? status,
  });
  
  // Check if user already has reservation for this target/time (one per event/spot instance)
  // Note: User can have multiple reservations at same spot/event for different times/days
  // CRITICAL: Uses agentId (not userId)
  Future<bool> hasExistingReservation({
    required String agentId, // Uses agentId, not userId
    required ReservationType type,
    required String targetId,
    required DateTime reservationTime, // Check for specific time
  });
  
  // Get user's reservations for a spot/event (all times)
  // CRITICAL: Uses agentId (not userId)

**Estimated Effort:** 24-30 hours (increased due to modification limits, ticket queue, policies, disputes)

---

### **1.3 Offline Ticket Queue Service** (Week 2, Days 1-3)

**File:** `lib/core/services/reservation_ticket_queue_service.dart`

**Purpose:** Internal ticket queue system for limited seats - allows offline users to get tickets with atomic timestamp ordering

**Core Methods:**
```dart
class ReservationTicketQueueService {
  // Queue ticket request (works offline, uses atomic timestamp)
  // CRITICAL: Uses agentId (not userId) for privacy-protected queue tracking
  Future<TicketQueueEntry> queueTicketRequest({
    required ReservationType type,
    required String targetId,
    required DateTime reservationTime,
    required int ticketCount,
    required String agentId, // Uses agentId, not userId
    required AtomicTimestamp purchaseTimestamp, // From AtomicClockService
  });
  
  // Process ticket queue (when online, sorts by atomic timestamp)
  Future<List<TicketAllocation>> processTicketQueue({
    required ReservationType type,
    required String targetId,
    required DateTime reservationTime,
  });
  
  // Get user's position in queue (based on atomic timestamp)
  // CRITICAL: Uses agentId (not userId)
  Future<int?> getQueuePosition({
    required String agentId, // Uses agentId, not userId
    required String queueEntryId,
  });
  
  // Allocate tickets from queue (first-come-first-served by atomic timestamp)
  Future<TicketAllocation> allocateTickets({
    required String queueEntryId,
    required int availableTickets,
  });
  
  // Handle queue conflicts (when syncing, uses atomic timestamps)
  Future<void> resolveQueueConflicts({
    required ReservationType type,
    required String targetId,
    required DateTime reservationTime,
  });
  
  // Check if user's ticket request will be fulfilled (before payment)
  Future<QueueStatus> checkQueueStatus({
    required String queueEntryId,
  });
}
```

**Model Updates:**
```dart
class TicketQueueEntry {
  final String id;
  final String agentId; // Uses agentId, not userId (privacy-protected)
  final ReservationType type;
  final String targetId;
  final DateTime reservationTime;
  final int ticketCount;
  final AtomicTimestamp purchaseTimestamp; // CRITICAL: Atomic timestamp
  final QueueStatus status; // pending, allocated, failed
  final DateTime createdAt;
}

enum QueueStatus {
  pending,      // Waiting for queue processing
  allocated,    // Tickets allocated
  failed,        // Too late, no tickets available
  refunded,      // Refunded due to failed allocation
}
```

**Offline-First Strategy:**
- Queue ticket requests locally (<50ms)
- **Get atomic timestamp** from `AtomicClockService` for purchase time
- **Hold payment** (don't charge until queue is processed)
- Allocate tickets optimistically (show confirmation)
- Sync queue when online
- **Sort by atomic timestamp** (true first-come-first-served)
- **Resolve conflicts** using atomic timestamps (offline vs. online)
- **Handle failed allocations** (refund or cancel payment hold)

**Payment Hold Strategy:**
- **Don't charge immediately** - Create payment intent but hold it
- **Process queue** when online (sort by atomic timestamp)
- **Charge only if tickets allocated** - Release hold if failed
- **Full refund** if user loses priority (too late in queue)
- **Better: Payment hold** - Don't charge until allocation confirmed

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ `ReservationTicketQueueService`
- ✅ `TicketQueueEntry` model (with atomic timestamp)
- ✅ `TicketAllocation` model
- ✅ `QueueStatus` enum
- ✅ **Atomic timestamp integration**
- ✅ **Payment hold mechanism**
- ✅ Offline queue management
- ✅ **True first-come-first-served** (atomic timestamp-based)
- ✅ Conflict resolution (atomic timestamps)
- ✅ Failed allocation handling (refund/hold release)
- ✅ Service tests

**Estimated Effort:** 14-18 hours (increased due to atomic clock integration, payment holds)

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ `ReservationTicketQueueService`
- ✅ `TicketQueueEntry` model
- ✅ `TicketAllocation` model
- ✅ Offline queue management
- ✅ Conflict resolution
- ✅ Service tests

**Estimated Effort:** 10-12 hours

**Pricing Model:**
- **Free by default** - Reservations are free unless business/expert requires fee
- **Business can require fee** - Set ticket price per reservation
- **SPOTS fee** - 10% of ticket fee (calculated automatically)
- **Optional deposits** - Business can require deposit (SPOTS takes 10% of deposit too)
- **Multiple tickets** - User can reserve multiple tickets (up to business limit or party size)

**Payment Hold Strategy (CRITICAL for Ticket Queue):**
- **For limited seats/tickets:** Don't charge immediately
- **Create payment intent** but hold it (Stripe payment intent with `capture_method: manual`)
- **Get atomic timestamp** for purchase time
- **Queue ticket request** with atomic timestamp
- **Process queue** when online (sort by atomic timestamp)
- **Charge only if tickets allocated** - Release hold if failed
- **Full refund** if user loses priority (too late in queue)
- **Better: Payment hold** - Don't charge until allocation confirmed

**Integration:**
- `PaymentService` - Process payment for paid reservations
- `ReservationService` - Link payment to reservation
- `ReservationTicketQueueService` - Queue ticket requests
- `AtomicClockService` - Get atomic timestamp for purchase time

- RevenueSplitService is designed for events/partnerships
- For reservations, create reservation-specific fee calculation OR adapt RevenueSplitService
- SPOTS fee: 10% of ticket fee (automatic)
- SPOTS deposit fee: 10% of deposit (automatic)
- Fee calculation happens in PaymentService, not RevenueSplitService (reservations are simpler)

**RefundService Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY GAP FIX):**
- Use existing `RefundService.processRefund()` for cancellation refunds
- Integration flow: Cancellation → Policy check → RefundService → Stripe refund
- Refund status tracked in Reservation model
- Refund history accessible via RefundService

**Flow (For Limited Seats/Tickets):**
```
User creates reservation (limited seats)
    ↓
Get atomic timestamp (AtomicClockService)
    ↓
Check if business requires fee
    ├─ Free → Queue ticket request with atomic timestamp
    └─ Paid → Create payment intent (HOLD, not charged)
        ├─ Ticket price * ticket count

    ↓
Show confirmation (optimistic UI)
    ↓
When online → Process queue (sort by atomic timestamp)
    ↓
Check if tickets available for this position
    ├─ YES → Allocate tickets, charge payment (capture intent)
    └─ NO → Release payment hold, refund if already charged, notify user
```

**Flow (For Regular Reservations - No Limited Seats):**
```
User creates reservation (no limited seats)
    ↓
Check if business requires fee
    ├─ Free → Create reservation directly
    └─ Paid → Calculate total:
        ├─ Ticket price * ticket count
        ├─ Deposit (if required)
        ├─ SPOTS fee (10% of ticket fee)
        └─ SPOTS deposit fee (10% of deposit)
    ↓
PaymentService.processPayment()
    ↓
Payment success → Reservation confirmed
Payment failure → Reservation cancelled
```

**Features:**
- Free reservations (default)

## 🔄 **EXISTING EVENT SYSTEM UPDATES REQUIRED**

### **Overview**

The dual identity system (agentId + optional EventUserData) applies to ALL event types, not just reservations. Existing event models must be updated to use this pattern.

### **Event Models Requiring Updates:**

#### **1. ExpertiseEvent Model** (Existing)
**File:** `lib/core/models/expertise_event.dart`

**Current:**
```dart
class ExpertiseEvent {
  final List<String> attendeeIds; // Uses userId
  // ...
}
```

**Required Update:**
```dart
class ExpertiseEvent {
  final List<String> attendeeAgentIds; // Changed from attendeeIds (uses agentId)
  final Map<String, EventUserData>? attendeeUserData; // NEW: Optional user data per attendee (agentId → EventUserData)
  // ... other fields
}
```

**Migration:**
- Update `attendeeIds` → `attendeeAgentIds`
- Add `attendeeUserData` map (optional)
- Update all services that use `attendeeIds`
- Update all UI that displays attendees

#### **2. CommunityEvent Model** (Existing)
**File:** `lib/core/models/community_event.dart`

**Current:**
- Extends `ExpertiseEvent`
- Inherits `attendeeIds` from `ExpertiseEvent`

**Required Update:**
- Inherits updated `ExpertiseEvent` with `attendeeAgentIds` and `attendeeUserData`
- No additional changes needed (inherits pattern)

#### **3. ClubEvent Model** (If Exists)
**File:** `lib/core/models/club_event.dart` (if exists)

**Required Update:**
```dart
class ClubEvent {
  final String agentId; // Internal tracking (privacy-protected)
  final EventUserData? userData; // Optional user data (shared with club if user consents)
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### **4. BusinessEvent Model** (If Exists)
**File:** `lib/core/models/business_event.dart` (if exists)

**Required Update:**
```dart
class BusinessEvent {
  final String agentId; // Internal tracking (privacy-protected)
  final EventUserData? userData; // Optional user data (shared with business if user consents)
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### **5. CompanyEvent Model** (If Exists)
**File:** `lib/core/models/company_event.dart` (if exists)

**Required Update:**
```dart
class CompanyEvent {
  final String agentId; // Internal tracking (privacy-protected)
  final EventUserData? userData; // Optional user data (shared with company if user consents)
  // ... other fields
}
```

### **Service Updates Required:**

#### **ExpertiseEventService** (Existing)
**File:** `lib/core/services/expertise_event_service.dart`

**Required Updates:**
- `registerForEvent()` - Use `agentId` (not `userId`), accept optional `EventUserData`
- `getEventsByAttendee()` - Use `agentId` (not `userId`)
- `getAttendees()` - Return `attendeeAgentIds` and optional `attendeeUserData`
- All methods that use `userId` → change to `agentId`

#### **CommunityEventService** (Existing)
**File:** `lib/core/services/community_event_service.dart`

**Required Updates:**
- Inherit updates from `ExpertiseEventService`
- Use `agentId` pattern for all attendee tracking

### **UI Updates Required:**

#### **Event Registration UI**
- Show data sharing options when registering for events
- Allow users to choose what data to share (name, phone, email, birthday, etc.)
- Works for: Community Events, Club Events, Expert Events, Business Events, Company Events

#### **Event Attendee Lists**
- Display attendees using `agentId` internally (privacy-protected)
- Display user data (if shared) to event host only
- Hide `agentId` from hosts (never share)

### **Timeline:**

**These updates should be done:**
- **Before Phase 9 starts** (if possible) - Ensures event system uses agentId
- **Or during Phase 9** - As part of reservation system integration
- **Critical:** Must complete before Phase 9 creates reservations that reference events

### **Migration Order:**

1. Update `ExpertiseEvent` model (attendeeIds → attendeeAgentIds)
2. Update `ExpertiseEventService` (use agentId)
3. Update `CommunityEvent` (inherits from ExpertiseEvent)
4. Update event registration UI (data sharing options)
5. Update event attendee display (privacy-protected)
6. Test event system with agentId
7. Phase 9 can then create reservations that reference events
