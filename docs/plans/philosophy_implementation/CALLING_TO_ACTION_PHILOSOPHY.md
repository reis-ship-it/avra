## 📐 **Mathematical Foundation**

### **The Calling Formula:**

```
Calling Score = f(
  user_vibe,
  opportunity_vibe,
  compatibility,
  context,
  timing
)

Where:
  user_vibe = User's vibe from AI2AI system
  opportunity_vibe = Spot/Event/List vibe
  compatibility = Vibe compatibility score (0.0 to 1.0)
  context = Current context (location, time, journey)
  timing = Optimal timing for suggestion

If Calling Score ≥ threshold:
  → User is "called" to action
  → Suggestion appears
  → User decides
```
