The AI2AI system works automatically in the background. Your AI learns from your actions and connects with nearby AIs to discover new doors.

## 🚪 **How It Works**

### **Automatic Discovery**

- Your AI automatically discovers nearby AIs
- Happens in the background
- No user action needed

### **Compatibility Matching**

- High compatibility = deep learning
- Medium compatibility = moderate learning
- Low compatibility = surface learning

### **Learning Exchange**

- AIs exchange learning insights
- Your AI learns from other AIs
- Other AIs learn from your AI
- All learning is privacy-preserving

- Your identity is never revealed
- Learning happens without exposing who you are
