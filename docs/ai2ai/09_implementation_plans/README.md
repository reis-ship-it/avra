## 🎯 **Quick Reference**

**Current Plans:**
- Identity matrix framework (quantum compatibility + matrix convergence) - **NEW**
- Asymmetric connections (allows one-way learning)
- Selective convergence (converge on similarities, preserve differences)
- BLE background usage (continuous operation)
- Offline AI2AI (peer-to-peer learning)
