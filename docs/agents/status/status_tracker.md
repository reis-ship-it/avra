# Agent Status Tracker - Dependency & Communication System

**Date:** November 30, 2025, 9:54 PM CST  
**Purpose:** Real-time status tracking for agent dependencies and communication  
**Status:** 🟢 Active - Phase 6 Complete, Phase 7 Section 47-48 Complete, Section 51-52 IN PROGRESS (Section 49-50 Deferred)
**Last Updated:** January 1, 2026 (Master Plan status made canonical here; removed duplicated status snapshots elsewhere)

---

## 🎯 **How This Works**

This file tracks:
- ✅ **What each agent is working on** (current task)
- ✅ **What's complete** (ready for other agents)
- ✅ **What's blocked** (waiting for dependencies)
- ✅ **Communication points** (when agents need to coordinate)

**Agents MUST update this file when:**
- Starting a new task
- Completing a task that others depend on
- Blocked waiting for a dependency
- Ready to share work with others

---

## 🧭 **Master Plan Status (Single Source of Truth)**

To avoid drift and contradictory “status snapshots” across docs:

- **Execution plan/spec:** `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`
- **Plan registry:** `docs/MASTER_PLAN_TRACKER.md`
- **Canonical status/progress:** **this file** (`docs/agents/status/status_tracker.md`)

**Rule:** If you need to know “what’s in progress / complete / blocked,” check here. Do not duplicate status tables in the Master Plan doc.

### **Master Plan Update: Phases 8 / 11 / 12 (execution slice) — AI learning journey “planned → real”**
**Status:** ✅ **Implemented in repo**; ⚠️ pending real-device validation for BLE/OS variance + Signal native runtime  
**Primary reference map:** `docs/agents/guides/AI_LEARNING_USER_JOURNEY_MAP.md`  
**Work log (source of truth):** `docs/agents/reports/agent_cursor/phase_8/2026-01-02_ai_learning_journey_plan_execution_complete.md`

**Implementation artifacts (high signal):**
- **Device-first onboarding truth (local mapping; cloud mirrors):**
  - `lib/core/services/onboarding_dimension_mapper.dart`
  - `lib/core/services/onboarding_aggregation_service.dart` (`mappingSource: device`)
  - Acceptance test: `test/unit/services/onboarding_aggregation_device_first_acceptance_test.dart`
- **Onboarding runtime resilience (best-effort knot):**
  - `lib/presentation/pages/onboarding/knot_discovery_page.dart`
- **Cloud LLM failover routing:**
  - `lib/core/services/llm_service.dart` (`CloudFailoverBackend`, `CloudGeminiGenerationBackend`)
  - Test: `test/unit/services/llm_cloud_failover_backend_test.dart`
- **Federated deltas made workable (12D contract + personalization overlay):**
  - `lib/core/ai2ai/embedding_delta_collector.dart`
  - `lib/core/ml/onnx_dimension_scorer.dart`
  - Tests:
    - `test/unit/ai2ai/embedding_delta_collector_test.dart`
    - `test/unit/ml/onnx_dimension_scorer_personalization_overlay_test.dart`
- **Optional cloud aggregation → priors applied locally:**
  - `lib/core/ai2ai/connection_orchestrator.dart` (applies `global_average_deltas` from `federated-sync`)
  - `supabase/functions/federated-sync/index.ts`

**Device validation checklist (BLE/OS variance + Signal native runtime):**
- **Setup (required)**
  - Two physical devices (A + B) on the same build.
  - Both devices **signed in** (Supabase auth) and app opened in foreground.
  - Permissions granted:
    - Android: Bluetooth scan/connect + Location (required for scanning), “Nearby devices” if prompted.
    - iOS: Bluetooth permission prompt accepted (and keep app foreground for initial validation).
- **Phase 8 (Onboarding truth + resilience)**
  - Complete onboarding on both devices.
  - Confirm onboarding is not blocked by knot runtime (knot page should continue even if knot unavailable).
  - Confirm “Offline AI” is **opt-out** on eligible devices (defaults enabled unless user disables).
- **Phase 11 (Chat routing + cloud failover)**
  - While online: verify chat returns a response (cloud path).
  - Optional: temporarily induce cloud failure (e.g., disable network mid-request) and confirm behavior degrades gracefully (no crash; error surfaced or fallback response).
- **Phase 23 (AI2AI discovery + encrypted learning insight delivery)**
  - Enable AI2AI discovery on both devices.
  - Place devices within ~1–3m for up to ~60s and confirm each sees the other in AI2AI UI.
  - Confirm a **non-placeholder** vibe/compatibility score is shown (truthful kernel; knot may degrade to quantum-only).
  - Trigger any available “connect/learn” interaction (if present in UI) and confirm:
    - No exceptions/crashes.
    - Evidence of a received insight being applied (e.g., updated last interaction / logs).
- **Federated (optional cloud path)**
  - With internet enabled, after at least one AI2AI learning event, wait ~30–60s.
  - Confirm the federated cloud queue sync runs without errors (best-effort; non-blocking).
- **Pass criteria**
  - No crashes.
  - Discovery works (devices appear).
  - Compatibility/vibe score is not a constant placeholder.
  - Learning insight handling is stable (no drift overflow/underflow; clamping is expected).
  - Cloud LLM path functions; failover is non-fatal.

### **Master Plan Update: Phase 14 (partial) — Community stream key rotation (seamless membership)**
**Status:** ✅ **Implemented + deployed to Supabase** (members stay in automatically; no user-visible “rejoin”)  
**Primary plan context:** Phase 14 “Sender Keys” group messaging (community chat)  
**Why:** admins can rotate sender keys without dropping honest members; revocations can still use hard rotation (no grace).

**Pending validation (blocked on hardware availability): Cross-platform 2-device Signal DM smoke over real transport**
- **Status**: ⏳ Ready in repo; waiting on iOS + Android physical devices
- **Goal**: Prove iOS↔Android Signal DM encrypt/decrypt over the *actual* Supabase “payloadless realtime” transport:
  - Ciphertext → `public.dm_message_blobs` (RLS: recipient-only read)
  - Notify → `public.dm_notifications` (realtime insert; payload = message_id only)
- **Artifacts**
  - Integration test: `integration_test/signal_two_device_transport_smoke_test.dart`
  - Runner script: `scripts/smoke/run_signal_two_device_transport_smoke.sh`
- **Run (when devices available)**:
  - Requires: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, two device ids (`flutter devices`), and two test accounts.
  - Optional: set `SIGNAL_SMOKE_COMMUNITY_ID` to also exercise community stream + sender-key flow.
  - Audit receipts: runner sets `SPOTS_LEDGER_AUDIT=true` and `SPOTS_LEDGER_AUDIT_CORRELATION_ID=$RUN_ID` so the run can be queried as a single ordered trail in `ledger_events_v0`.
  - Expected ordering checklist: `docs/agents/reports/agent_cursor/phase_23/2026-01-02_ble_signal_ledgers_receipts_backup_plan_execution_complete.md`

**Repo changes (source of truth):**
- Client “silent refresh” + anti-stale behavior:
  - `lib/core/services/community_sender_key_service.dart`
  - `lib/core/services/community_chat_service.dart`
- DB migrations added:
  - `supabase/migrations/032_community_sender_key_rotation_grace_window.sql`
  - `supabase/migrations/033_community_message_blobs_member_rls.sql`

**Supabase deploy verification (SPOTS_ project):**
- ✅ Migration applied: `community_sender_key_rotation_grace_window`
- ✅ Migration applied: `community_message_blobs_member_rls`
- ✅ Live E2E smoke test: 2-user send/receive, rotate key, refresh membership, decrypt OK.

**Planned follow-up (UI/UX):**
- ⏳ Add “Rotate community key” admin action button in community chat UI (soft vs hard rotation, confirmation UX, grace picker).
