# Agent Task Assignments - MVP Core (Weeks 1-4)

**Date:** November 22, 2025, 8:40 PM CST  
**Purpose:** Specific task assignments for 3 agents working in parallel  
**Usage:** Copy the agent section and use as prompt: "[AGENT_X_SECTION] you are agent X, follow the task exactly as written."

---

## 🎯 **Overview**

This document provides specific, actionable task assignments for 3 agents working on **MVP Core features (Weeks 1-4)**. This is a **TRIAL RUN** - if successful, we'll continue with the remaining Master Plan phases.

**Trial Run Scope:** Weeks 1-4 (MVP Core) = 20% of total Master Plan  
**Total Master Plan:** 20 weeks (Weeks 1-20)  
**Trial Run Reference:** `docs/TRIAL_RUN_SCOPE.md` - See what's included and what comes after

**Master Plan Reference:** `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md` (Weeks 1-4: MVP Core Functionality)  
**MVP Analysis Reference:** `docs/MVP_CRITICAL_ANALYSIS.md`  
**Quick Reference Guide:** `docs/AGENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - **READ THIS FIRST** for code examples and patterns

---

## 📖 **Before Starting Work**

**All agents MUST read:**
1. ✅ This task assignment document (your agent section)
2. ✅ `docs/AGENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Code examples, patterns, design tokens
3. ✅ `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md` - Overall context
4. ✅ `.cursorrules` - Project rules and standards

**This ensures clarity and consistency across all agents.**

---

## 📋 **Agent Roles**

- **Agent 1:** Payment Processing & Revenue (Backend + Integration)
- **Agent 2:** Event Discovery & Hosting UI (Frontend)
- **Agent 3:** Expertise UI & Testing (Frontend + Quality Assurance)

---

## 🔄 **Coordination Protocol**

### **Can All Agents Start Simultaneously? YES, with Coordination**

**✅ All 3 agents CAN start at the same time, but with this strategy:**

1. **Agent 1 (Payment Backend):** Start immediately - no dependencies
2. **Agent 2 (Event UI):** Start with Event Discovery UI (Week 2 tasks) - no dependencies, can work in parallel
3. **Agent 3 (Expertise UI):** Start immediately - no dependencies, completely independent

**⚠️ Critical Coordination:**
- Agent 2's **payment UI** (Week 1, Task 2.3) must wait for Agent 1's payment models (Day 2)
- Agent 2 should start with **Event Discovery UI** (Week 2 tasks) instead of payment UI
- Agent 3 can work completely independently Weeks 1-3
- Week 4 requires all agents to coordinate for integration testing

### **Recommended Parallel Start Strategy:**

**Week 1 (All Start Simultaneously):**
- **Agent 1:** Payment backend (Days 1-5) - CRITICAL PATH
- **Agent 2:** Start Event Discovery UI early (Week 2 tasks, Days 1-5) - Can work in parallel
- **Agent 3:** Expertise UI (Days 1-5) - Completely independent

**Week 2:**
- **Agent 1:** Backend improvements (Days 1-5)
- **Agent 2:** Continue Event Discovery UI (Days 1-5) - Then do payment UI after Agent 1's models ready
- **Agent 3:** Expertise unlock indicator (Days 1-5)

**Week 3:**
- **Agent 1:** Service improvements (Days 1-5)
- **Agent 2:** Event Hosting UI (Days 1-5)
- **Agent 3:** Test planning (Days 1-5)

**Week 4:**
- **Agent 1:** Integration testing support (Days 1-5)
- **Agent 2:** UI polish (Days 1-5)
- **Agent 3:** Integration testing (Days 1-5) - Coordinates with Agents 1 & 2

### **Daily Sync Points:**
1. **Model Definitions:** Agent 1 shares payment models when complete (Day 2)
2. **Integration Points:** Agents share service interfaces and integration points
3. **Design Tokens:** All agents verify `AppColors`/`AppTheme` usage (100% adherence required)
4. **Progress Updates:** Update Master Plan progress daily

### **Critical Dependencies:**
- **Week 1 Day 2:** Agent 1 must define payment models before Agent 2 can build payment UI
- **Week 2:** Agent 2 needs existing `ExpertiseEventService` (already exists) ✅
- **Week 3:** Agent 2 needs payment models from Agent 1 for event hosting integration ✅ (already done Week 1)
- **Week 4:** Agent 3 needs all features complete for integration testing (coordinate daily)
